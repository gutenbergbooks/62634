&ldquo;The Germ&rdquo;
</h2>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> 1850 an astounding thing happened
in England. A little group
of artists and poets, known as the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood, began the publication
of a magazine. It was to be
given over to &ldquo;thoughts towards nature
in poetry, literature, and art&rdquo;; and it
was called <em>The Germ</em>.
</p>

<p>
The idea was Dante Gabriel Rossetti&rsquo;s,
who was then just twenty-two years old.
Thomas Woolner, of the same age, and
Holman Hunt and Millais, both somewhere
in the neighborhood of twenty,
were dragged willingly into the plan.
William Michael Rossetti, aged nineteen,
was made editor; James Collinson
and Frederick George Stephens were
added to the four original P. R. B.&rsquo;s;
John Lucas Tupper, Ford Madox
Brown, Walter Howell Deverell, William
Cave Thomas, John Hancock, and Coventry
Patmore were intimately connected
with the project; and Christina, then
eighteen, offered her poems for publication
therein.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Germ</em> was published for four
months, and then it died. Like all serious
things it could find no immediate audience;
like all revolutionary things it
was called juvenile and regarded with
shyness; and like all original and beautiful
things it has managed to stay very
much alive. For, in 1899, a limited
edition of <em>The Germ</em> in facsimile was
brought out, and William Michael Rossetti
wrote an extensive introduction for
it in which he described minutely the
whole glorious undertaking. It is these
facsimiles that we have been looking
through with such awe, and which tell
such an interesting story.
</p>

<p>
Here was a league of &ldquo;unquiet and
ambitious young spirits, bent upon making
a fresh start of their own, and a
clean sweep of some effete respectabilities.&rdquo;
On the night of December 19,
1849, when the first issue of the magazine
was impending, they met in Dante
Rossetti&rsquo;s studio at 72 Newman Street to
discuss a change of title. <em>The P. R. B.
Journal and Thoughts Towards Nature</em>
(the &ldquo;extra-peculiar&rdquo; suggestion of
Dante, according to his brother) had
been discarded, and Mr. Cave Thomas
had drawn up a list of sixty-five possibilities,
among them <em>The Seed</em>, <em>The
Scroll</em>, <em>The Harbinger</em>, <em>First Thoughts</em>,
<em>The Sower</em>, <em>The Truth-Seeker</em>, <em>The
Acorn</em>, and <em>The Germ</em>. The last was decided
upon and the first issue came out
about the first of January. Seven hundred
copies were printed and about two
hundred sold. This wasn&rsquo;t encouraging,
so the second issue was limited to five
hundred; but it sold even less well than
the first, and the P. R. B.&rsquo;s were at the
end of their resources. Then the printing-firm
came to the rescue and undertook
the responsibility of two more numbers.
The title was changed to <em>Art and
Poetry, being Thoughts towards Nature,
conducted principally by Artists</em>; but &ldquo;all
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
efforts proved useless.... People would
not buy <em>The Germ</em>, and would scarcely
consent to know of its existence. So the
magazine breathed its last, and its obsequies
were conducted in the strictest
privacy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It did attract some critical attention,
however. <em>The Critic</em> wrote: &ldquo;We cannot
contemplate this young and rising
school in art and literature without the
most ardent anticipation of something
great to grow from it, something new
and worthy of our age, and we bid them
godspeed upon the path they have adventured.&rdquo;
Others remarked that the
poetry in <em>The Germ</em> was all beautiful,
&ldquo;marred by not a few affectations&mdash;the
genuine metal, but wanting to be purified
from its dross&rdquo;; &ldquo;much of it of extraordinary
merit, and equal to anything
that any of our known poets could write,
save Tennyson....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Well&mdash;the situation demands a philosopher.
We might undertake the rôle
ourselves, except that we&rsquo;re too near the
situation, having just started a magazine
with certain high hopes of our own.
</p>

<p>
On the cover of each issue of <em>The
Germ</em> appeared this poem by William
Rossetti, the mastery of which, some one
said, would require a Browning Society&rsquo;s
united intellects:

a long review of Clough&rsquo;s <em>Bothic of
Toper-na-fuosich</em> make up the first number.
In the others are <em>The Blessed Damozel</em>,
Christina&rsquo;s <em>An End</em> and <em>A Pause of
Thought</em>, Patmore&rsquo;s <em>Stars and Moon</em>,
John Orchard&rsquo;s <em>Dialogue on Art</em>, and
many other things of value, concluding
with a review of Browning&rsquo;s <em>Christmas
Eve and Easter Day</em>, in which William
Rossetti establishes with elaborate seriousness,
through six pages of solemn and
awesome sentences, that &ldquo;Browning&rsquo;s
style is copious and certainly not other
than appropriate&rdquo;; that if you <em>will</em> understand
him, you shall.
</p>

<p>
All this came to our mind the other
day when some one accused us of being
&ldquo;juvenile.&rdquo; What hideous stigma was
thereby put upon us? The only grievous
thing about juvenility is its unwillingness
to be frank; it usually tries to
appear very, very old and very, very
wise. <em>The Germ</em> was quite frankly
young; otherwise it could not have been
so full of death poetry, for it is youth&rsquo;s
most natural affectation to steep itself
in death. But <em>The Germ</em> might have
been even more &ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; and so
avoided some of the heavy, sumptuous
sentences in that Browning review. It
would have gained in readableness without
any possible sacrifice of beauty or
truth. In their poetry the Pre-Raphaelites
were as simple and spontaneous as
children; in their criticism they were
rhetorical. Our sympathy is somehow
very strongly with the spontaneity&mdash;whatever
dark juvenile crimes it may be
guilty of&mdash;in the eyes of those who
merely look but do not see.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> his voluptuous vagabondage
Rousseau at length halted at Paris,
where he managed to worry through
some inconstant years. The thing that
saved the day for him was the fragment
of a pamphlet that blew across his path
in one of his rambles, announcing a
prize to be awarded by the Academy of
Dijon for the best answer to an
extraordinary question. Had the renascence
of the arts and sciences ennobled
morals? That was a flash of lightning
which lit up a murky night and helped
this bewildered and lonely wanderer to
get his bearings. Thoughts came to
him demoniacally which shaped his
entire future and won him no small place
in the history of humanity.
</p>

<p>
Answer is &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Rousseau.
And his answer was awarded the
academic prize.
</p>

<p>
It seems strange that the history of
his times sided with Rousseau&rsquo;s &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Certainly it was the first fiery meteor
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
of the French revolution. It pronounced
the first damnatory sentence upon a
culture that had already reached the
point of collapse. In his own body and
soul Rousseau had bitterly experienced
the curse of this culture. It was
largely responsible for his heart&rsquo;s abnormal
yearning whose glow was consuming
him. Instead of ennobling morals this
culture had inwardly barbarized man.
Then it galvanized and painted the outside
of life. And then life became a
glittering lie.
</p>

<p>
Thus Rousseau became prophet in
this desert of culture, and called men
to repentance. &ldquo;Back from culture to
nature,&rdquo; was his radical cry; back from
what man has made out of himself to
what nature meant him to be. Nature
gave man free use of his limbs; culture
has bound them with all sorts of bindings,
until he is stiff, and short-winded,
and crippled. According to nature man
lives his own life; man is what he seems
and seems what he is; according to culture
he is cunning, and crafty, and
mendacious.
</p>

<p>
The eighteenth-century man of culture
hearkened with attentive soul to the
dirge in which one of its noblest sons
vented his tortured heart. The melancholy
music bruised from this prophet&rsquo;s
heart silenced the wit and ridicule of
even a Voltaire, who wanted to know,
however, whether &ldquo;the idea was that
man was to go on all fours again.&rdquo; In
a few decades the feet of revolutionary
Frenchmen were at the door ready, with
few and short prayers, to bear to its last
abode that culture whose moral worth
even a French Academy had called in
question, and for whose moral condemnation
had awarded the first prize.
</p>

<p>
Now it is our turn! What is the good
of our culture? Such is the query of
a host of people who know nothing
thereof save the wounds it has inflicted
upon them&mdash;a host of people who face
our culture with the bitter feeling that
they have created it with the sweat of
their brows, but have not been permitted
to taste its joys. Such, too, is the query
of others who, satiated with its beneficence,
have been its pioneers,&mdash;a John
Stuart Mill, political economist, who
doubts whether all our cultural progress
has mitigated the sufferings of a single
human being; a Huxley, naturalist, who
finds the present condition of the larger
part of humanity so intolerable today
that, were no way of improvement to be
found, he would welcome the collision
of a kindly comet that would smash our
petty planet into smithereens.
</p>

<p>
Also, there is your proletariat. And
there is your culture on summits far
out of his reach. The more inaccessible
it is, shining there with a radiance that
never falls upon him, the less does he
reflect that all is not gold that glitters.
Then there is your philanthropist, foremost
in culture of mind and heart,
surveying the masses far beneath him,
in the slime and grime of life, and
doubting at last whether any labor of
love can lift men up to where he thinks
men ought to be; whether, after all, it
can bring joy to men who are sick and
sore with the load of life.
</p>

<p>
Not to be partial, one may magnanimously
cite your philistine also&mdash;the
man of &ldquo;the golden mean,&rdquo; the &ldquo;man of
sanity,&rdquo; as mediocrity has ever brand-marked
itself, who &ldquo;hates <em>ultra</em>.&rdquo; For
the life of him your philistine cannot
understand how a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; man can
have any doubt about our culture. Does
he not read in his favorite newspaper how
gloriously we have progressed? Does
he not encore the prodigious achievements
of our technique? Has he not
heard his crack spellbinder orate on the
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
cultural felicity that follows our flag?
Down with the disloyalty of highbrow
doubters!
</p>

<p>
Now it was from an entirely different
side, indeed it was from an entirely
different standpoint, that Friedrich
Nietzsche contemplated modern culture,
particularly the national culture of the
German Fatherland. What horrified
him was not simply the <em>content</em>, but the
<em>criterion</em>, of our culture. He sharply
scrutinized the <em>ideals</em> which we set ourselves
in our culture. He found not
simply our achievements but our ideals,
<em>ourselves</em> even, so inferior, so vulgar,
so contemptible, that he began to doubt
whether even the Germans could be recognized
as a culture people or not.
Hence Nietzsche became the most ruthless
iconoclast of our culture. Unlike the
majority, unlike the scholars, the philanthropists,
the philistines, Nietzsche was
not moved by the misery of the masses,
by the great social need of our time.
He did not regret that the boon of our
culture was shared by so few, inasmuch
as, in his opinion, this boon was of very
doubtful value. He found our life so
barbarous, so culture-hostile, that he
still missed the first elements of a true
culture among us.
</p>

<p>
Hence Nietzsche lunged against <em>status
quo</em>. He did what he himself called
&ldquo;<em>unzeitmässig</em>,&rdquo; untimely. He flung a
question, more burning than any other,
into our time&mdash;more burning than even
the social question, constituting indeed
the main part of that question. It was
the question as to how <em>man</em> fared in this
culture&mdash;the question as to what <em>man</em>
got out of it and as to what it got out
of man.
</p>

<p>
Never before had this question been
put as Nietzsche put it. We should
recall that Nietzsche was not one of
those who had experienced the extremes
of either plenty or want, nor was he
one of those who filled the wide space
between the two. To him, the pessimism
of the discontented and the optimism of
the fortunate and the satisfied were alike
superficial, if not impertinent. It was not
a question of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; at all. In
bitter, biting sarcasm he says, with reference
to the English utilitarian &ldquo;happiness
morality&rdquo;: &ldquo;I do not seek my
happiness; only an Englishman seeks
his happiness; I seek my <em>work</em>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No; his was a question which his conscience
put to culture. Was it a &ldquo;culture
of the <em>earth</em>, or of <em>man</em>?&rdquo; Here
Nietzsche probes home. And he alone
did it. The most diverse censors of our
time had not seen and said that no matter
how desirable, no matter how gloriously
conceived the new order of things
might be, <em>man</em> must be the decisive
thing; <em>man</em> must tip the scales. It was
this that went against the grain. Mightier
machines, larger cities, better apartments,
bigger schools, what was the good
of it all, <em>et id omne genus</em>, if new and
greater men did not arise? So said
Nietzsche. And he said it with high
scorn to a generation which had forgotten
that man is not for &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; but
culture for man; of man, by man, for
man.
</p>

<p>
Every people seems to pass through a
period in which it is obsessed with the
idea that the causes of popular prosperity
are at once motive and criterion of
culture; that the natural laws of economics
are the universally valid norms of
the ebb and flow of human values; that a
balance on the balance sheet to the good,
the satisfactoriness of the statistics of
exports and imports to the wishes of the
interested parties, are an occasion for
jubilation over the ascent which life has
compassed. Harbor some scruple as to
whether the jubilation be warranted or
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
not, and you are at once pilloried as a
pessimist and a malcontent. And yet had
there been no Nietzsche there would still
remain Cicero&rsquo;s warning: &ldquo;Woe to a
people whose wealth grows but whose
men decay.&rdquo; But there was a Nietzsche,
and he dared to call even his Fatherland
Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;flat country&rdquo;&mdash;flat was a
hard word for a land that could once
boast of so many poets and thinkers.
But now the flatter the better! But now
no peaks to scale, no yawning abysses on
whose edges one grows dizzy! Nothing
a single step removed from the ordinary,
the conventional! Now heights
and depths, distinctions and distances,
these are valid in the world of quantity,
not of quality; of possession, not of being;
of tax tables, not of human essence
and human power! Now all men are
equal! But Nietzsche knew that if men
are equal they are not free; if free they
are not equal. With a fury and a fire
that literally consumed him, he dedicated
himself to the task of leading men
up out of this flatness, away from this
leveling&mdash;up to an appreciation of the
potential&mdash;not the actual&mdash;greatness
of man&rsquo;s life. Greatness is not yet man&rsquo;s
verity but his vocation, his true and
idiomatic destiny. Greatness? This is a
man&rsquo;s strength of will; the unfolding of
a free personality. To say <em>I will</em> is to be
a man. All human values are embraced
in this <em>I will</em>. To produce men who can
say <em>I will</em> is at once the task and the test
of culture. This <em>I will</em> is the climax and
goal of man. In this <em>I will</em> vanishes
every fearsome and disquieting <em>I must</em>,
every compulsion of outer necessity.
Not the passive adjustment of man to
nature, but the active adjustment of
nature to man; nature outside of him
and nature inside of him&mdash;that is human
calling and human culture. Vanishes,
also, every <em>I ought</em>. Man refuses to be
ridden by a duty spook, but subordinates
even duty to himself. Duty, too, is for
the sake of man, not man for the sake of
duty. In the depths of his own being,
man reserves the sovereign right to speak
his <em>yes</em> and his <em>no</em> to duty. To his own
will he subjects all good and all evil
taught him by others, past or present,
and thus occupies a standpoint &ldquo;beyond
good and evil.&rdquo; Lord of the Sabbath?
Yes, but lord also of standards sanctified
by their antiquity; lord of all the standards
of life; lord of all that has been
written or thought or done. &ldquo;And thou,
O lord, art more than they!&rdquo; Thou&mdash;thou
alone&mdash;art central and supreme
and sacred and inviolable. &ldquo;Bring forth
the royal diadem and crown him lord of
all!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But not yet! Alas, there are no such
lords, no such will-men, personality-men!
Such men are not <em>Gegenwartsmenschen</em>,
present day men, but <em>Zukunftsmenschen</em>,
future day men; not reality but task&mdash;our
task. That future man will surpass
present man as much as present man surpasses
the monkey which he in his development
has left behind. We are bridges
from monkey to superman. Superman!
In him at last, at last, all that is unliving,
unfree, withered and weak, all that is
sickly in man, shall be obliterated; and
all the forces that are great and creative
shall be unfolded and molded into cultural
values.
</p>

<p>
This is the meaning of the superman
of Friedrich Nietzsche. Malice and
ignorance have vied&mdash;vainly we may
now hope&mdash;in caricaturing it. The way
to superman is the rugged, steep mountain
path up to conscious deed and
mighty achievement; not the gentle incline
down to stupid indulgence, indolent
disposition, enervating or bestial impulsive
life. Not that! Superman is precisely
the man who overcomes the man of
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
today aweary of life and athirst for
death.
</p>

<p>
This preaching of Superman might be
called Messianic. It is the bold faith
that we are not the last word of the Word
of life; it is the glad hope that the best
treasures, the greatest deeds, the supreme
goals of humankind are still in the
future. Nietzsche&rsquo;s message is a breath
of spring blowing over the land proclaiming
the advent of an issue from the
womb of time of something greater, better
than anything we have been, than
anything we have called good or great;
the advent of a new day when our best
songs now will be our worst then; our
noblest thoughts now our basest then;
our highest achievements now, our poorest
by-products then.
</p>

<p>
We shall usher in that day; superman
shall be our will, our deed! Superman
gives our life worth. Ours is the new,
exhilarating responsibility, swallowing
up and nullifying all the petty responsibilities
which fret us today. We have
to justify our lives to that great future,
to that coming one, to our children.
They, through us, must be greater, better,
freer, than all of us put together.
We are worth our contribution to the
achievement of future man. Nay, only
superman can justify the history of the
cosmos! Consider pre-human and sub-human
life, red in tooth and claw; consider
human life, often not much better
and sometimes much worse; consider ourselves,
our meanness and our mediocrity.
Is this all? Is this warrant for the long
human and pre-human story? Can you
escape the conviction that but for superman
the eternal gestation and agony of
cosmic maternity admits of no rational
vindication?
</p>

<p>
Breed, then, with a view of breeding
supermen. Marriage? Let this be not
for ease, not for the propagation of
yourselves; the pushing of yourselves
into your children, parents, but for the
creation of something new, of superman!
Education? Not to assimilate the children
to us, to the past, but to free them
from us; not <em>Vaterland</em>, but <em>Kinderland</em>,
must be our concern. Children shall not
&ldquo;sit at our feet&rdquo; but stand upon our
shoulders, that they may have a freer and
broader sweep of the horizon. And in
our children we shall love the Coming
One, prepare the way for Superman, that
free, great man who shall have conquered
present petty man with all his slave instincts!
Such, at all events, are the
dreams of the great poetic and prophetic
philosopher of the German Fatherland
of today.

A New Winged Victory
</h2>

</div>

<p class="book">
<em>Angel Island</em>, by Inez Haynes Gillmore.
[Henry Holt and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<em><span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">ngel</span> Island</em> is several rare things:
original, profound, flaming. It leaves
you with a gasping sense of having been
swept through the skies; and also with
that feeling of new life which comes with
a plunge into cold, deep seas. <em>Angel
Island</em> is a new kind of Winged Victory!
</p>

<p>
Innumerable books have been written
about the conflict of the sexes, about the
emergence of the new woman. Most of
them are dull books. But Mrs. Gillmore&rsquo;s
is beautiful and exciting. I kept
thinking as I read it: here is something
absolutely new, absolutely authentic;
something so full of vision and truth
that it&rsquo;s like getting to the top of a
mountain for the sunrise. Its freshness
and its clearness are like cool morning
mists that the sun has shot through.
</p>

<p>
But to discard vague phrases and get
to the story&mdash;for it is not a tract, but
a novel&mdash;or rather a poetic allegory&mdash;that
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
that Mrs. Gillmore has written. Five
men of representative modern types&mdash;a
professor, a libertine, a soldier of
fortune, a &ldquo;mere mutt-man,&rdquo; and an
artist&mdash;are shipwrecked on a tropical
island. After a few days their attention
is caught by what appears to be huge
birds flying through the heavens. The
birds come nearer and prove to be
winged women! Then comes the story
of their wooing, their capture, their
ultimate evolution into what modern
women have decided they want to be:
humanists.
</p>

<p>
However, this is going too fast. The
only way to appreciate <em>Angel Island</em> is
to be conscious of the art of it as you
read. Beginning with the shipwreck,
Mrs. Gillmore creates a series of brilliant
pictures that culminate in the flying
orgies of the bird-women.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
... All this was intensified by the anarchy
of sea and sky, by the incessant explosion
of the waves, by the wind which seemed to
sweep from end to end of a liquefying universe,
by a downpour which threatened to beat their
sodden bodies to pulp, by all the connotation of
terror that lay in the darkness and in their unguarded
condition on a barbarous, semi-tropical
coast....
</p>

<p>
The storm, which had seemed to worry the
whole universe in its grip, had died finally but
it had died hard. On a quieted earth, the sea
alone showed signs of revolution. The waves,
monstrous, towering, swollen, were still marching
on to the beach with a machine-like regularity
that was swift and ponderous at the same
time.... Beyond the wave-line, under a
cover of foam, the jaded sea lay feebly palpitant
like an old man asleep....
</p>

<p>
They had watched the sun come up over the
trees at their back. And it was as if they had
seen a sunrise for the first time in their lives.
To them it was neither beautiful nor familiar;
it was sinister and strange. A chill, that was
not of the dawn but of death itself, lay over
everything. The morning wind was the breath
of the tomb, the smells that came to them from
the island bore the taint of mortality, the very
sun seemed icy. They suffered&mdash;the five survivors
of the night&rsquo;s tragedy&mdash;with a scarifying
sense of disillusion with Nature....
</p>

<p>
The sun was racing up a sky smooth and clear
as gray glass. It dropped on the torn green sea
a shimmer that was almost dazzling; but there
was something incongruous about that&mdash;as
though Nature had covered her victim with a
spangled scarf. It brought out millions of
sparkles in the white sand; and there seemed
something calculating about that&mdash;as though
she were bribing them with jewels to forget....
</p>

<p>
Dozens of waves flashed and crashed their
way up the beach; but now they trailed an iridescent
network of foam over the lilac-gray
sand. The sun raced high; but now it poured a
flood of light on the green-gray water. The air
grew bright and brighter. The earth grew warm
and warmer. Blue came into the sky, deepened&mdash;and
the sea reflected it. Suddenly the world
was one huge glittering bubble, half of which
was the brilliant azure sky and half the burnished
azure sea.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
All this is gorgeous enough&mdash;this
clear, vivid painting of nature. But
when Mrs. Gillmore turns her hand to
the supernatural, she is simply ravishing.
For instance:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The semi-tropical moon was at its full. Huge,
white, embossed, cut out, it did not shine&mdash;it
glared from the sky. It made a melted moonstone
of the atmosphere. It faded the few
clouds to a sapphire-gray, just touched here and
there with the chalky dot of a star. It slashed
a silver trail across a sea jet-black except where
the waves rimmed it with snow. Up in the
white enchantment, but not far above them, the
strange air-creatures were flying. They were
not birds; they were winged women!
</p>

<p>
Darting, diving, glancing, curving, wheeling,
they interwove in what seemed the premeditated
figures of an aerial dance.... Their wings,
like enormous scimitars, caught the moonlight,
flashed it back. For an interval, they played
close in a group inextricably intertwined, a revolving
ball of vivid color. Then, as if seized
by a common impulse, they stretched, hand in
hand, in a line across the sky&mdash;drifted. The
moonlight flooded them full, caught glitter and
gleam from wing-sockets, shot shimmer and
sheen from wing-tips, sent cataracts of iridescent
color pulsing between. Snow-silver one, brilliant
green and gold another, dazzling blue the
next, luminous orange a fourth, flaming flamingo
scarlet the last, their colors seemed half liquid,
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
half light. One moment the whole figure would
flare into a splendid blaze, as if an inner mechanism
had suddenly turned on all the electricity;
the next, the blaze died down to the fairy glisten
given by the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
As if by one impulse, they began finally to fly
upward. Higher and higher they rose, still hand
in hand.... One instant, relaxed, they
seemed tiny galleons, all sails set, that floated
lazily, the sport of an aerial sea; another, supple
and sinuous, they seemed monstrous fish whose
fins triumphantly clove the air, monarchs of
that aerial sea.
</p>

<p>
A little of this and there came another impulse.
The great wings furled close like blades
leaping back to scabbard; the flying-girls
dropped sheer in a dizzying fall. Half-way to
the ground, they stopped simultaneously as if
caught by some invisible air plateau. The great
feathery fans opened&mdash;and this time the men
got the whipping whirr of them&mdash;spread high,
palpitated with color. From this lower level,
the girls began to fall again, but gently, like
dropping clouds.... They paused an instant
and fluttered like a swarm of butterflies
undecided where to go.... Then they
turned out to sea, streaming through the air in
line still, but one behind the other. And for
the first time, sound came from them; they
threw off peals of girl-laughter that fell like
handfuls of diamonds. Their mirth ended in a
long, eerie cry.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
To me, that is wonderful work&mdash;one
jeweled word after another. And it&rsquo;s
sustained through the whole book. But
of course, after this first sense of ravishment
with her pictures, you touch upon
the deeper wonder of Mrs. Gillmore&mdash;her
ideas. There are enough ideas in
<em>Angel Island</em> to equip the women who
are fighting for selfhood with armour
that is absolutely hole proof.
</p>

<p>
The winged women differ in type as
widely as the men; and each man chooses
very quickly the type that appeals to
him most. The libertine wants the big
blond one, whom they&rsquo;ve named
&ldquo;Peachy&rdquo;; the professor likes Chiquita,
the very feminine, unintellectual one;
Billy, the mere man, falls violently and
reverently in love with the radiant Julia,
the leader of the group and the one
your interest centers in immediately.
Julia has a personality: she appears to
be &ldquo;pushed on by some intellectual or
artistic impulse, to express by the symbols
of her complicated flight some theory,
some philosophy of life.&rdquo; She seems
always to shine. She is a creator. In
short, Julia thinks.
</p>

<p>
The men plan capture and finally accomplish
it by a time-honored method:
that of arousing the women&rsquo;s curiosity.
Then follows a tragic episode when they
cut the captives&rsquo; wings, making flight
impossible. Of course, marriage is the
next step, and later, children are born
on Angel Island&mdash;little girl children
with wings, and boys without them. But
all this time Julia has refused to marry
Billy, though she&rsquo;s in love with him.
Her only reason is that something tells
her to wait.
</p>

<p>
Inevitably the women mourn the loss
of their wings; and just as they become
reconciled to a second-hand joy in their
daughters&rsquo; flights, Peachy&rsquo;s husband
informs her that flying is unwomanly&mdash;that
woman&rsquo;s place is in the home,
not in the air (!)&mdash;and that their
daughter must be shorn of her wings
as soon as she&rsquo;s eighteen.
</p>

<p>
What next? Rebellion, with Julia
shining gloriously as leader. She had
been waiting for this. And in ten pages
of profound, simple, magnificent talk&mdash;if
only every woman in the world would
read it!&mdash;she explains to the others that
they must learn to walk. Peachy objects,
because she dislikes the earth.
&ldquo;There are stars in the air,&rdquo; she argues.
&ldquo;But we never reached them,&rdquo; answers
Julia. The earth is a good place, and
they must learn to live in it. Besides,
their children will fly better for learning
to walk, and walk better for knowing
how to fly; and she prophesies that
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
<em>then</em> will be born to one of them a boy
child with wings.
</p>

<p>
The women hide and master the art
of walking. While they&rsquo;re doing this
their poor wings have a chance to grow
a little, and by the time the men are
ready to capture and subdue them a
second time they have achieved a combination
of walking and flying that puts
them beyond reach. Then the men submit
... and Julia asks Billy to marry
her.
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s all, except one short chapter
about Julia. She has a son with wings!
And then she dies&mdash;radiant, white, goddess-woman,
whose life had been so fine
a thing. The beauty of it all simply
overwhelmed me.
</p>

<p>
All of which points to several important
conclusions. First, that Mrs.
Gillmore is a poet and prophet of golden
values. Second, that prejudice is the
most foolish thing in the world. A general
prejudice against that obvious form
of comedy called farce might cause you
to miss <em>The Legend of Leonore</em>. And
a stubborn caution in regard to allegories&mdash;which,
I concede, generally <em>are</em>
unsubtle&mdash;might keep you from <em>Angel
Island</em>.

Two Views of H. G. Wells
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
I am just reading <em>The Passionate
Friends</em>, and every time I read anything
of Wells&rsquo;s I wonder why it is I
don&rsquo;t like him better. <em>The World Set
Free</em> that has been running in <em>The
Century</em> was intensely worth while, I
thought&mdash;really prophetic. One tasted
something almost divine; human nature
is capable of such wonderful undreamed
of things! It was like Tennyson prophesying
the Federation of the World, airships,
etc. Wells does seem inspired in
some ways. But every time I read any
of his novels&mdash;well, you remember I
have a distinct mid-Victorian flavor that
has to be reckoned with. I wasn&rsquo;t
brought up in a minister&rsquo;s family for
nothing! I suppose it&rsquo;s what we used
to call our conscience. Mine isn&rsquo;t much
good, alas; I sometimes think of it as
a little old Victorian lady. She sits in
the background of my consciousness and
knits and knits and nods her head. Meanwhile
I go blithely about, espousing all
sorts of causes and thinking out all sorts
of theories&mdash;imagining, you know, that
I&rsquo;m perfectly free. Suddenly she wakes
up&mdash;she lays aside her knitting with a
determined air and says, &ldquo;Mary Martha,
<em>what</em> are you thinking about! Stop that
right now; I&rsquo;m ashamed of you.&rdquo; And
she has authority, too, you know. I
stop. Ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;but so it is.
</p>

<p>
And every time I read a Wells novel
my little old lady folds her hands and
sits up very primly and says, &ldquo;Aha,
you&rsquo;re reading something of that man&rsquo;s
again. Well, I&rsquo;m not asleep&mdash;I&rsquo;m right
on the job and I know just what I think
of <em>him</em>.&rdquo; So you see! And the worst&mdash;or
the best&mdash;of it is that I agree with
her. I can&rsquo;t like him. I read along and
it&rsquo;s all so reasonable&mdash;he&rsquo;s so clever and
he <em>thinks</em>; but his conclusions are all so
weak&mdash;if he comes to any. One passage
in <em>The Passionate Friends</em> has made me
furious. How can a man who&rsquo;s at all
worth while be so really wicked&mdash;(another
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
word gone out of style). I mean
this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It is manifestly true that for the most of us
free talk, intimate association, and any real
fellowship between men and women turns with
extreme readiness to love. And that being so,
it follows that under existing conditions the
unrestricted meeting and companionship of men
and women in society is a notorious sham, a
merely dangerous pretence of encounters. The
safe reality beneath those liberal appearances is
that a woman must be content with the easy
friendship of other women and of one man only,
letting a superficial friendship towards all other
men veil impassable abysses of separation, and
a man must in the same way have one sole
woman intimate.... To me that is an intolerable
state of affairs, but is reality.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Now can you suppose that is Wells&rsquo;s
own reasoning that he puts into the
mouth of his unfortunate hero? Talk
about Edith Wharton being thin-lipped
in the pursuit of her heroines&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a great deal better than being loose-lipped;
don&rsquo;t you agree with me? It
may be true, and I rather think to some
extent it is true, that a man cannot have
an absorbing friendship with a woman
and not run the risk of falling in love.
But what does that prove? That he
should be allowed free rein and carry on
as many <em>liaisons</em> veiled under the name of
friendship as he chooses? Or unveiled,
rather, for Wells seems to want everything
in the open. He&rsquo;s like a child
who says: Here&rsquo;s a very dangerous beast
in a flimsy, inadequate cage. Frequently
he escapes from it and has to be put back
in. Let&rsquo;s abolish the cage and let the
beast run about openly, doing what it
wants. And the good old-fashioned word
for that beast is lust, and it should be
caged; if the cage is getting more and
more inadequate it&rsquo;s only a piece with
what Agnes Repplier calls our loss of
nerve. How I liked that article of hers!
What in the name of sense are we in this
world for if not to build up a character?
That&rsquo;s all that amounts to anything, and
it comes from countless denials and
countless responses to duty. And what
Goethe said, some time ago, is still everlastingly
true: &ldquo;<em><a id="corr-3"></a>Entbehren sollst
Du, sollst <a id="corr-4"></a>entbehren!</em>&rdquo; (Deny yourself,
deny, deny.) He ought to know, too,
because he tried indulgence, goodness
knows, and knew the dregs at the bottom
of that cup. And I can&rsquo;t forgive
Wells. He knows better than to let
people make all manner of experiment
with such things. They wouldn&rsquo;t even
be happy; for happiness is built of stability,
loyalty, character, and again character.
My husband said, after reading
that passage in <em>The Passionate Friends</em>,
&ldquo;The trouble with him and the class he
writes of is that they aren&rsquo;t busy enough.
Let &rsquo;em work for a living, be interested
in something vitally for ten hours out of
the twenty-four, and they&rsquo;ll forget all
about their neighbors&rsquo; wives and be content
with good men friends and casual
women friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The trouble lies with poor old human
nature, I guess, and the way it wants
what it cannot and ought not to have.
But Wells says all unreality is hateful
to him. Let&rsquo;s tear down the barriers,
let&rsquo;s show up for what we are. Poor
Smith wants something his neighbor has&mdash;well,
let&rsquo;s give it to him, whether it&rsquo;s
his neighbor&rsquo;s success or his wife or his
happiness. Nature is still unbearably
ugly in lots of ways. When we can
train it to be unselfish and disinterested
then it will be time to tear down barriers.
</p>

<p>
Lady Mary in <em>The Passionate Friends</em>
is an unconvincing character, too. I can
conceive of a woman who will take all
of a man&rsquo;s possessions, giving him nothing
in return, not even fidelity, but I cannot
conceive of her justifying herself
unless she is an utter moral degenerate.
The danger of such writers as Wells is
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
that they are plausible enough till you
look below the surface. He tries to represent
Lady Mary as charming, but she,
it seems to me, even more than modern
society which he arraigns, is &ldquo;honeycombed
and rotten with evil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="sign">
&ldquo;M. M.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="vspace noindent">
The description of a &ldquo;little old Victorian
lady&rdquo; who sits in the background
of our consciousness and plays conscience
for us is charming; but.... She&rsquo;s a
sweet-faced little lady to whom the universe
is as clear as crystal and as simple
as plane geometry. She is always knitting,
and what she knits is a fine web of
sentimentality with which to cover the
nakedness of truth&mdash;&ldquo;for it is not
seemly, my dear, that anything, even
truth, should be naked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This web of hers is as fine as soft
silk and as strong as chain mail. It&rsquo;s
sticky, too. And it clothes truth so thoroughly
that she grows unrecognizable to
any but the most penetrating searcher&mdash;to
H. G. Wells, for instance. It&rsquo;s natural
enough that the old lady should dislike
Wells, for he&rsquo;s found her out; he&rsquo;s
made the astonishing discovery that underneath
the web life is not sentimentally
simple. He discloses to her scandalized
eyes various unfortunate facts which she
has done her best to conceal, as for instance
the fact that there is such a thing
as sex.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sex,&rdquo; says Wells in effect in every
one of his novels, &ldquo;is a disturbing element,
<em>the</em> disturbing element, in life. So
long as sex exists it is a physical impossibility
that life should be the sweetly
pretty parlor game our little Victorian
lady would have it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Right here the husband of the little
lady has something to say: &ldquo;The trouble
with him and the class he writes of,&rdquo; he
announces, &ldquo;is that they aren&rsquo;t busy
enough. Let &rsquo;em work for a living, be
interested in something vitally for ten
hours out of the twenty-four, and they&rsquo;ll
forget all about their neighbors&rsquo; wives
and be content with good men friends
and casual women friends.&rdquo; This is an
excellent example of what Wells finds the
next most disturbing element in life&mdash;&ldquo;muddle-headedness,&rdquo;
the lack of ability
to think straight, to think things
through. &ldquo;Let Wells be vitally interested
in something for ten hours of the twenty-four!&rdquo;
Doesn&rsquo;t he see that if Wells had
ever limited himself to ten hours of interest
he would be making shirts today? It
is because Wells works twenty-five hours
of the twenty-four at being &ldquo;vitally interested
in something&rdquo; that he is one of
the major prophets of our time. And the
thing in which he is interested is life itself,
the great unsolvable mystery, life
which extends below the simple, polished
surface that is all the Victorian lady
knows as the sea extends below its glassy
smoothness on a summer day.
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest things that Wells
has done for some of us who came on him
young enough so that our minds did not
close automatically at his first startling
revelation, is this: he taught us to look
at life squarely, without moral cant, and
with a scientific disregard as to whether
it pleased us personally or not. We may
not always agree with him&mdash;very likely
we don&rsquo;t&mdash;but at least we must face
the issue squarely and not take refuge
in the vague sentimentality and slushy
hopefulness of the Victorian lady.
</p>

<p>
Wells states facts and very frequently
lets it go at that. Witness the shock this
method is to our little old lady. She
asks how anyone at all worth while can
be so &ldquo;really wicked&rdquo; as to write about
sex and society as he does.
</p>

<p>
She admits that what he says is a fact,
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
<em>but</em>&mdash;it sticks out like a jagged, untidy
rock from the smooth surface of things;
therefore it is wicked. As a matter of
fact that statement of his has no more
to do with morality, is no more wicked,
or virtuous, than the statement of a
physical fact&mdash;to say, for instance, that
glass breaks when hurled against a stone
wall. It is unfortunate, but it is not
&ldquo;wicked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No, the day of Victorianism is past.
We are slashing away the web, we are
learning to <em>think</em>. It is a slow and painful
process and we know not yet where
the struggle will end. But at least we
shall be nearer to the divine nakedness of
truth. If Wells has done nothing else
than to prove to us how much of our
thinking is dictated not by our own souls
but by the artificially-imposed sentimentality
of the &ldquo;little old Victorian lady&rdquo;
he has done a full man&rsquo;s work. And we
who owe our emancipation largely to his
vision can never be too thankful to him.

Rupert Brooke and Whitman
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
You treated Brooke in a masterly way
in the last issue. I saw many things I
hadn&rsquo;t seen before, and understood the
<em>Wagner</em> better. But I disagree with you
in one way.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Wagner</em> and the <em>Channel Passage</em>
are merely clever realistic satire&mdash;that&rsquo;s
always worth while. But it&rsquo;s the thought
behind the <em>Menelaus and Helen</em> sort of
thing that I don&rsquo;t like. Of course there&rsquo;s
no doubt that Helen grew wrinkled and
peevish. But to say that therefore Paris
in his grave was better off than Menelaus
living is just a bit decadent, isn&rsquo;t it?
I&rsquo;m forced to picture Brooke as the sort
of chap who couldn&rsquo;t enjoy a good dinner
if he had to wash the dishes afterward:&mdash;instead
of regarding dishwashing
as a natural variety of living that
could be thoroughly enjoyable with
shirtsleeves and a pipe. I&rsquo;m afraid he
wouldn&rsquo;t play American football for fear
of getting his face dirty. He&rsquo;s just a
bit finicky about life. He&rsquo;s afraid to
commit himself for fear he&rsquo;ll have to
endure something about which he can&rsquo;t
weave golden syllables. That&rsquo;s the reason
I don&rsquo;t agree with you about Whitman
liking all of him. Whitman was
frank about the whole world, dirt and
all, and he accepted it enthusiastically.
Brooke writes about dirt in such a way
as to make it seem horrible.

More About the &ldquo;New
Note&rdquo;
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The idea of &ldquo;the new note&rdquo; might
be worked out more fully, but after all
little or nothing would be gained by
elaboration. Given this note of craft
love all the rest must follow, as the spirit
of self-revelation, which is also a part of
the new note, will follow any true
present-day love of craft. You will remember
we once discussed Coningsby
Dawson&rsquo;s <em>The Garden Without Walls</em>.
What I quarreled with in that book was
that the writer looked outside of himself
for his material. Even realists have done
this&mdash;as, for example, Howells; and to
that extent have failed. The master
Zola failed here. Why do we so prize the
work of Whitman, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky,
Twain, and Fielding? Is it not because
as we read we are constantly saying to
ourselves, &ldquo;This book is true. A man
of flesh and blood like myself has lived
the substance of it. In the love of his
craft he has done the most difficult of
all things: revealed the workings of his
own soul and mind&rdquo;?
</p>

<p>
To get near to the social advance for
which all moderns hunger, is it not necessary
to have first of all understanding?
How can I love my neighbor if I do not
understand him? And it is just in the
wider diffusion of this understanding
that the work of a great writer helps
the advance of mankind. I would like
to have you think much of this in your
attitude toward all present-day writers.
It is so easy for them to bluff us from
our position, and I know from my own
experience how baffling it is constantly
to be coming upon good, well-done work
that is false.
</p>

<p>
In this connection I am tempted to
give you the substance of a formula I
have just worked out. It lies here before
me, and if you will accept it in the
comradely spirit in which it is offered I
shall be glad. It is the most delicate and
the most unbelievably difficult task to
catch, understand, and record your own
mood. The thing must be done simply
and without pretense or windiness, for
the moment these creep in your record is
no longer a record, but a mere mass of
words meaning nothing. The value of
such a record is not in the facts caught
and recorded but in the fact of your having
been able truthfully to make the record&mdash;something
within yourself will tell
you when you have not done it truthfully.
I myself believe that when a man
can thus stand aside from himself, recording
simply and truthfully the inner
workings of his own mind, he will be
prepared to record truthfully the workings
of other minds. In every man or
woman dwell dozens of men and women,
and the highly imaginative individual
will lead fifty lives. Surely this can be
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
said if it can be said that the unimaginative
individual has led one life.
</p>

<p>
The practice of constantly and persistently
making such a record as this
will prove invaluable to the person who
wishes to become a true critic of writing
in the new spirit. Whenever he finds
himself baffled in drawing a character
or in judging one drawn by another,
let him turn thus in upon himself, trusting
with child-like simplicity and honesty
the truth that lives in his own mind.
Indeed, one of the great rewards of living
with small children is to watch their
faith in themselves and to try to emulate
them in this art.
</p>

<p>
If the practice spoken of above is
followed diligently, a kind of partnership
will in time spring up between the
hand and the brain of the writer. He
will find himself becoming in truth a
cattle herder, a drug clerk, a murderer,
for the benefit of the hand that is writing
of these, or the brain that is judging
the work of another who has written of
these.
</p>

<p>
To be sure this result will not always
follow, and even after long and patient
following of the system one will run into
barren periods when the brain and the
hand do not co-ordinate. In such a
period it seems to me the part of wisdom
to drop your work and begin again
patiently making a record of the workings
of your own mind, trying to put
down truthfully those workings during
the period of failure. I would like to
scold every one who writes, or who has
to do with writing, into adopting this
practice, which has been such a help and
such a delight to me.

<span class="smallcaps">Agnes Repplier on Popular Education</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">hrough</span> all of Miss Repplier&rsquo;s
latest essays in <em>The Atlantic</em> runs a
note of appeal for the sterner virtues,
which she thinks are in danger of dying
out under modern conditions. So persistently
is this note, admirable in itself,
sounded, that we wonder if it doesn&rsquo;t
hark back a bit to Sparta, and the casting
away of the unfit. When it comes
to the question of an education broad
enough to fit the needs of every child, we
may all pause and take a deep breath.
We may not approve of a school of
moving pictures, advocated by Judge
Lindsey, and yet we may not wish to go
to the other extreme of severe discipline
advocated by Miss Repplier. If only all
children were of exactly the same type,
so that the same kind of schooling would
suffice for all their needs! Or even if
they could come from the same kind of
homes with more or less similar ideals!
</p>

<p>
Let us hear what she and Mr. Lindsey
have to say about Tony&mdash;(Tony is a
boy who does not like school as it is at
present organized). &ldquo;Mr. Edison is
coming to the rescue of Tony,&rdquo; says
Judge Lindsey. &ldquo;He will take him away
from me and put him in a school that is
not a school at all but just one big game....
There will be something moving,
something doing at that school all the
time. When I tell him about it Tony
shouts &lsquo;Hooray for Mr. Edison!&rsquo; right
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
in front of the battery, just as he used
to say &lsquo;To hell wid de cop!&rsquo;&rdquo; On the
other hand:&mdash;&ldquo;The old time teacher,&rdquo;
says Miss Repplier, &ldquo;sought to spur the
pupil to keen and combative effort, rather
than beguile him into knowledge with
cunning games and lantern slides....
The old time parent set a high value on
self discipline and self control.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But can she believe for one moment
that Tony&rsquo;s parents ever dreamed of
&ldquo;setting a high value on self discipline
and self control?&rdquo; Or that Tony&rsquo;s sister
was taught to &ldquo;read aloud with correctness
and expression, to write notes with
propriety and grace, and to play backgammon
and whist?&rdquo; ...
</p>

<p>
<em>Figurez-vous!</em> And so, if we can reach
little Tony&rsquo;s darkened vision by the simple
method of moving pictures, keep him
off the streets until he learns at least not
to become a hardened criminal&mdash;are we
not that much to the good? Tony will
never, never be ambassador to the court
of St. James (or if he is going to be,
he&rsquo;ll be it in spite of movies!) but he may
be a fairly honest, happy fruit vendor
some day, instead of No. 207 in a cell.
Useless to cite the dull boys in school,
who absolutely refused pedagogic training
and later blazed their way&mdash;luminaries&mdash;through
the world, when once
they had found the work that interested
them. To interest, stimulate, and arouse
is the prelude to work; and precious few
kiddies, except those who don&rsquo;t really
need it, do enough work that they dislike
to strengthen their little characters. But
even if they do, are those who will not
to have nothing?
</p>

<p>
Of course, education is a thing that
can&rsquo;t be disposed of in a few well meaning
phrases. Miss Repplier may be
right, too, in what she says of the education
of Montaigne. You remember he
learned to talk Latin under a tutor, at an
early age, in much the same way that our
modern young ones learn French and
German.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the boy gained by the most elaborate
system ever devised for the saving
of labor,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;was that he over-skipped
the lower forms in school. What
he lost was the habit of mastering his
prescript lessons, which he seems to have
disliked heartily.&rdquo; But how does any
one know that that was all he gained?
I should hardly select Montaigne as my
model, if I were trying to point out the
ill effects of any particular type of education.
Besides, whatever its effect may
have been on him, I should hate to lose
the mental picture of the little lad Latinizing
with the &ldquo;simple folk of Perigord.&rdquo;
Charming little lad, and wonderful old
father, doing his best to elevate and help
his boy. No, decidedly; whatever Miss
Repplier may do to dispose of Tony
and his ilk, I am glad she had nothing
whatever to do with the education of
Montaigne!

<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Since it appears to be my duty to read
all the critical journals and dissect their
contents for these columns, I can&rsquo;t in
good faith neglect <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
I have just devoured the first issue. What
can I say about the superb &ldquo;announcement&rdquo;?
I agree ardently with it. It
needed to be said; the magazine needed
to be born. There&rsquo;s no quarrel between
art and life except where one or the other
is kept back of the door. Anyone with a
keen appreciation of art can&rsquo;t help appreciating
life too, and Mrs. Jones who
runs away from her husband can&rsquo;t fairly
stand for &ldquo;life.&rdquo; Besides, why should
anybody object to a thing because it&rsquo;s
transitorial? Everything is transitorial.
It must either grow or perish.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wing&rsquo;s criticism of <em>Mr. Faust</em> is
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
admirable&mdash;direct, unpretentious, sound.
But you must let me register a slight objection
to Dr. Foster&rsquo;s Nietzsche article.
It seems to me there&rsquo;s just too much enthusiasm
to be borne by what he actually
says. When I came to the end of
that third paragraph on page fifteen I
sneaked back to Galsworthy&rsquo;s letter and
found an answering twinkle in its eye. I
felt like going up to Dr. Foster with a
grin, putting my hand on his shoulder
and saying, &ldquo;My dear man, a candidate
for major prophet doesn&rsquo;t need political
speeches. It is really not half so important
that we unregenerate should give
three cheers for him as that we should
live his truth. Won&rsquo;t you forget a little
of this sound and fury and tell us as simply
as you can just what it is that you
want us to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I went from his article with the impression
that here was a man who was
very enthusiastic about Mr. Nietzsche.
I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not the impression Dr.
Foster intended to make. But I have a
feeling that pure enthusiasm wasting itself
in little geysers is intrinsically ridiculous.
Enthusiasm should grow trees
and put magic in violets&mdash;and that
can&rsquo;t be done with undue quickness, or in
any but the most simple way. Nobody
cares about the sap except for what it
does. And, anyhow, it always makes me
savage to be orated at, or told that my
soul will be damned if I don&rsquo;t admit the
particular authority of Mr. Jehovah or
Mr. Nietzsche or Mr. anybody else.
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s all by the way, however, and
the impression of the magazine as a
whole is clear, true, swift. Its impact
can&rsquo;t be forgotten. You haven&rsquo;t attained
your ideal&mdash;which is right; but
you&rsquo;ve done so well you&rsquo;ll have to
scratch to keep up the speed,&mdash;which is
right, too.

Women and the Life Struggle

<p class="book">
<em>The Truth About Women</em>, by C. Gasquoine Hartley (Mrs. Walter M. Gallichan).
[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">rs.</span> Gallichan has not told the whole
truth about woman; but she has told as
much of it as has been told by any one
writer except Olive Schreiner; and although
she has made no important discovery,
educed no brilliant new conclusion,
she has summarized the best of all
that has been said in a book which can
scarcely fail to render notable service.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to recall how the truth
about women has been disclosed. The
voice of Mary Wollstonecraft, crying in
the wilderness, in 1792, pleaded that &ldquo;if
woman be not prepared by education to
become the companion of man, she will
stop the progress of knowledge; for
truth must be common to all.&rdquo; Yet
it was nearly sixty years before
Frederick Denison Maurice was able to
open Queen&rsquo;s College, and give a few
English women the opportunity of an
education. (In America, Mary Lyon
had already broken ground for the
higher education of her countrywomen.)
</p>

<p>
Here and there, in those days, an intrepid
female declared herself a believer
in woman&rsquo;s rights; but her pretensions
were scarcely honored to the point even
of ridicule. Women were inferior creatures,
designed and ordered by God to
be subordinate to men. Didn&rsquo;t everything
go to prove it? And, indeed,
nearly everything seemed to!
</p>

<p>
In 1861, several scholarly gentlemen
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
in Europe were delving in fields of research
where they were destined to upturn
facts of great interest to the
inferior sex. One of these was John
Stuart Mill, whose impassioned protest
against the subjection of women was
then being written, although it was not
published until eight years later. Another
was Henry Maine, who was disclosing
some significant things about the
ancient law on which our modern laws
are founded. Another was Lecky, who
was gathering material for his <em>History
of European Morals, from Augustus
to Charlemagne</em>, and&mdash;incidentally&mdash;discovering
that &ldquo;natural history of
morals&rdquo; wherewith he was to shock the
world in 1869. But two of the others
were searching back of Augustus&mdash;&ldquo;back&rdquo;
of him both in point of time
and also in degree of civilization. One
of these was Bachofen, a German, who
published, in 1861, <em>Das Mutterrecht</em>,
in which he made it clear that women
had not always been subordinate, dependent,
but among primitive peoples
had been the rulers of their race. McLennan&rsquo;s
<em>Primitive Marriage</em>, published
in 1865, brought prominently to British
thinkers this quite-new contention of
woman as a creature born to rule, but
defrauded and degraded.
</p>

<p>
Then, in 1871, Darwin startled the
world with <em>The Descent of Man, and
Selection in Relation to Sex</em>; and those
who accepted his theory of evolution
had to revise all their previous notions
about the relations of the sexes.
</p>

<p>
During the next quarter-century
many minds were busy with this wholesale
revision of ideas, but nothing signal
was set forth until Charlotte Stetson&mdash;working
with the historical data of
Maine and Mill and Lecky and their
followers, with the ethnological data of
Bachofen and McLennan, and many
more, and with the natural history of
morals as Darwin and Wallace and
Huxley and their school disclosed it&mdash;declared
that the enslavement of women
was economic in its origin and in its final
analysis. This was not the whole truth,
but it was so important a part of the
whole that the book <em>Women and Economics</em>
may be said to have given the
most productive stimulus the feminist
movement had had since <em>The Descent of
Man</em>.
</p>

<p>
Scores, almost hundreds, of books
dealing with some phase or other of
woman&rsquo;s history, appeared in the next
few years. But while many of them
were valuable, and some were all but
invaluable, none of them was epoch-marking
until Olive Schreiner put forth
her magnificent fragment on <em>Woman
and Labor</em>, the chapter on Parasitism
being the noblest and most pregnant
thing that any student of woman has
given to the world. Olive Schreiner saw
much further into the question of women
and economics than Charlotte Stetson
knew how to see. She has a greater
vision. She perceives that women are
ennobled by what they do&mdash;just as men
are&mdash;and that they are degraded by
being denied creative, productive labor&mdash;not
by being denied the full reward
of their toil.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gallichan does not advance upon
the contribution of Mrs. Schreiner, as
Mrs. Schreiner did upon that of Mrs.
Stetson; but she had less opportunity to
do so: Mrs. Schreiner did not leave so
much for some one else to say. But Mrs.
Gallichan has summarized all that has
been said more fully than any other
writer has done; and she has done it so
interestingly, so ably, that she deserves
grateful praise.
</p>

<p>
Her book has three sections: the biological,
the historical, and the modern.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
Let no one resent or think useless an analogy
between animal love-matings and our own. In
tracing the evolution of our love-passions from
the sexual relations of other mammals, and back
to those of their ancestors, and to the humbler,
though scarcely less beautiful, ancestors of
these, we shall discover what must be considered
as essential and should be lasting, and what is
false in the conditions and character of the
sexes today; and thereby we shall gain at once
warning in what directions to pause, and new
hope to send us forward. We shall learn that
there are factors in our sex-impulses that require
to be lived down as out-of-date and no longer
beneficial to the social needs of life. But encouragement
will come as, looking backwards,
we learn how the mighty dynamic of sex-love
has evolved in fineness, without losing in intensity,
how it is tending to become more mutual,
more beautiful, more lasting.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Two suggestions which Mrs. Gallichan
makes in the biological section are especially
striking. One is derived from the
bee, and one from the spider. The bee,
she reminds us, belongs
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
to a highly evolved and complex society, which
may be said to represent a very perfected and
extreme socialism. In this society the vast majority
of the population&mdash;the workers&mdash;are
sterile females, and of the drones, or males, only
a very few at the most are ever functional.
Reproduction is carried on by the queen-mother ...
specialized for maternity and incapable
of any other function.... I have little
doubt that something which is at least analogous
to the sterilization of the female bees is present
among ourselves. The complexity of our social
conditions, resulting in the great disproportion
between the number of the sexes, has tended to
set aside a great number of women from the
normal expression of their sex functions.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
The danger to society, when maternity
shall be left to the stupid parasitic
women who are unable to exist as
workers, is pointed out by Mrs. Gallichan;
as is also that exaggerated form
of matriarchy which is realized among
the ants and bees. And she reminds
women who are workers, not mothers,
that in the bee-workers the ovipositor
becomes a poisoned sting. She warns
women not to become like the sterile
bees; but she warns them also against
state endowment of motherhood. And
she does not suggest how the great
excess of women are to become mothers
without reorganizing society.
</p>

<p>
The second example she cites in warning,
the common spider, whose courtship
customs Darwin described in <em>The
Descent of Man</em>, is &ldquo;a case of female
superiority carried to a savage conclusion.&rdquo;
And from this female who ruthlessly
devours her lover, Mrs. Gallichan
deduces a theory for &ldquo;many of those
wrongs which women have suffered at
the hands of men. Man, acting instinctively,
has rebelled, not so much, I think,
against woman as against this driving
hunger within himself, which forces him
helpless into her power.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stages by which parasitism was
transferred from the male to the female
still need some elucidation&mdash;like the
stages by which marriage passed from
endogamy to exogamy. But Mrs. Gallichan&rsquo;s
suggestion about the male preserving
himself by appearing as self-sufficient
and as dominant as he can, is
highly interesting. It will probably not
be long before we know a great deal
more of this.
</p>

<p>
In the historical section of her book,
Mrs. Gallichan devotes four admirable
chapters to the mother-age civilization,
and four others to the position of women
in Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome.
</p>

<p>
Of immense significance is the relation
between the enviable status of women in
Egypt and that love of peace and of
peaceful pursuits which characterized
the Egyptian people. War, patriarchy,
and the subjection of women, have gone
hand in hand. Social organizations in
which might was right have minimized
the worth of women; those in which ingenuity,
resourcefulness, and ideality
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
were set above brute force have given
women most justice.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gallichan&rsquo;s chapter on the women
of Athens and of Sparta is most suggestive.
So is that on the women of
Rome.
</p>

<p>
In her modern section she discusses
women and labor:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The old way of looking at the patriarchal
family was, from one point of thought, perfectly
right and reasonable as long as every woman
was ensured the protection of, and maintenance
by, some man. Nor do I think there
was any unhappiness or degradation involved
to women in this co-operation of the old days,
where the man went out to work and the
woman stayed to do work at least equally
valuable in the home. It was, as a rule, a
co-operation of love, and in any case it
was an equal partnership in work. But
what was true once is not true now. We are
living in a continually changing development
and modification of the old tradition of the relationship
of woman and man.... The
women of one class have been forced into labor
by the sharp driving of hunger. Among the
women of the other class have arisen a great
number who have turned to seek occupation
from an entirely different cause, the no less bitter
driving of an unstimulating and ineffective
existence, a kind of boiling-over of women&rsquo;s
energy wasted, causing a revolt of the woman-soul
against a life of confused purposes, achieving
by accident what is achieved at all. Between
the women who have the finest opportunities
and the women who have none there is this
common kinship&mdash;the wastage not so much of
woman as of womanhood.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
She considers &ldquo;the women who have
been forced into the cheating, damning
struggle for life,&rdquo; and urges that &ldquo;the
life-blood of women, that should be given
to the race, is being stitched into our
ready-made clothes; washed and ironed
into our linen; poured into our adulterated
foods&rdquo;; and so on. But her
reasoning in this chapter is not very
clear. Women, to avoid parasitism, must
work, and only a relatively small proportion
of them can now find in their
homes work enough to keep them self-sustaining.
Protest against the sweating
of women is not only philanthropic&mdash;it
is perfectly sound political economy.
Women workers not only should
be protected against long hours, unnecessary
risks, insanitary surroundings,
merciless nerve tension, and the computation
of their wages on a basis of their
assured ability to live partly by their
labor and partly by the legitimatized or
unlegitimatized sale of their sex; but
this <em>can</em>, and <em>must</em>, be done. Yet, when
all this has been accomplished, will Mrs.
Gallichan feel satisfied that the struggle
for life is not &ldquo;cheating, damning,&rdquo; if
owing to conditions we cannot regulate
that struggle fails also to comprehend
the struggle to give life, to reproduce?
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It is because we are the mothers of men that
we claim to be free.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
This is the keynote of her book. But
she is by no means clear in her mind as
to how the mothers of men are to maintain
themselves in a freedom which shall
be real, not merely conceded; nor as to
how the millions of women who, under
our monogamous societies, cannot be
permanently mated, are to justify their
struggle for existence by becoming
&ldquo;mothers of men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The something that Mrs. Gallichan
lacks, not in her retrospect so much as
in her previsioning, has been lacked by
many of the great investigators and
writers who have built up the magnificent
literature of evolution and evolutionary
philosophy: she has an admirable
survey of the &ldquo;whenceness&rdquo; of life
and love and labor, but a short-sighted,
astigmatic vision of its &ldquo;whereuntoness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If the sole purpose of life and love
and labor, among humans as among
lower animals, is to continue life, to
transmit the life-force, then indeed are
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
those frustrated, futile creatures who
are cheated, or who cheat themselves,
out of rendering this one service to the
world which can justify them for having
lived in it.
</p>

<p>
But if, as most of us believe, we are
more than just links in the human chain;
if we have a relation to eternity as
well as to history and to posterity, there
are splendid interpretations of our
struggles that Mrs. Gallichan does not
apprehend. If souls are immortal, life
is more than the perpetuation of species,
or even than the improvement of the
race; it is the place allotted to us for the
development of that imperishable part
which we are to carry hence, and through
eternity. And any effort of ours which
helps other souls to realize the best that
life can give, to seek the best that immortality
can perpetuate, may splendidly
justify our existence.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gallichan&rsquo;s conclusion about religion
is that it is an &ldquo;opium&rdquo; to which
women resort when they have no proper
outlet for their sex-impulses. &ldquo;I am
certain,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;that in us the religious
impulse and the sex impulse are
one.&rdquo; And when she was able to satisfy
the sex impulse, she no longer had any
need of or interest in religion.
</p>

<p>
The limitations this puts upon her
interpretation of life are too obvious to
need cataloging. And this is the reason
she signally fails to tell the whole of
the truth about woman. This is the
reason why the latter chapters of her
book, in which she writes of marriage
and divorce and prostitution, are of less
worth to the generality of readers than
the earlier ones; though this is not to
say that these chapters do not contain a
very great deal of vigorous thinking and
excellent suggestion. But to anyone
who holds that the continuance of life
is the principal justification for having
lived, yet deplores free love and state
endowment of mothers, there is inevitably
an appalling waste, for the elimination
of which she may well be staggered
to suggest a remedy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gallichan&rsquo;s book is not constructive
in effect. But it is so excellently
analytical, as far as it goes, that it can
scarcely fail to provoke a great deal of
thought.

<p>
Two old God-fearing Welsh people
have denied themselves of comforts and
pleasures to give their sons an education.
Then, when they expect to reap the benefits
of the sacrifice, three unexpected and
awful things happen: the student son
has so fallen under the influence of
modern skepticism as to be forced to
abandon his father&rsquo;s Calvinistic creed.
The second one has become soaked with
socialism and syndicalism. The third,
a chronic invalid, is a Christian and a
comfort; but he is killed, quite unnecessarily,
in a labor conflict instigated
by his brother. Then&mdash;the two old
people again, alone. What can a playwright
do with such a situation? Nothing,
certainly, to attract a &ldquo;capacity
house.&rdquo; But we shall be among the first
of that small minority who likes thinking
in the theatre to hear what Mr. Francis
has to say. His theme is tremendous.

The Poetry of Alice Meynell
</h2>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">N</span><span class="postfirstchar">ot</span> least among the stirring events
of our present poetical renaissance
are the publication of the collected editions
of the works of Alice Meynell and
Francis Thompson (Scribner). Spiritually
akin, mutually influencing one another
in material as in more subtle ways,
their poetry stands in vivid contrast to
the muse of our younger singers, the
makers of what English critics hail as a
new Georgian Age. That this difference
gives them an added significance, and not
as some critics have said, a lessened one,
is the burden of the present appreciation
of the poems of Alice Meynell. For
there is a tendency for the reader who
is intoxicated with poetic modernity to
reason somewhat after this fashion.
Here, he will say,&mdash;as indeed Mr. Austin
Harrison has said of Francis Thompson&mdash;is
a &ldquo;reed pipe of neo-mediaevalism ...
a poet of the gargoyle,&rdquo; not of
this modern world, and so neither in sympathy
of thought or melody with us of
the twentieth century, its free life and
<em>vers libre</em>. All this, of course, because,
Francis Thompson was&mdash;as is Mrs.
Meynell&mdash;a child of the Catholic
Church. Our supposititious reader will
continue to the effect that there is no
spiritual profit to be had in reading these
poets when the modern attitude is to be
found in such writers as W. W. Gibson,
Masefield, and Hardy. But in so arguing,
our reader will be entirely wrong as
to the facts, and mistaken in his whole
manner of approach to the realm of
poetic values.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Max Eastman, in his charming
book, <em>The Enjoyment of Poetry</em>, lays
stress on the fact that poetry is not primarily
the registering of emotions but
the expression of keen realizations. A
mathematical concept may arouse an
emotion, but the poet makes the actual
emotion transmissible by his selective
power in picking out the focal point of
the experience by which it is aroused.
If poetry is essentially realization of life,
then we have no longer any excuse for
asking our poets to share our doctrinal
views before we consent to read them.
On the contrary, we should be more anxious
to read Mrs. Meynell than Mr. Gibson,
if we are modernists, for Mr. Gibson
may, conceivably, not be able to tell
us anything we have not already felt.
Mrs. Meynell, on the other hand, can inform
our feelings with fresh aspects of
experience, and she does so abundantly.
Her Catholicism is not mediaevalism, but,
in so far as it is translatable into her
poetry it is simply a vocabulary for
the expression of certain emotional realizations
of life which we modernists find
it very hard to express because we do not
have the necessary vocabulary. What
can be more modern than the doctrine of
the immanence of God and his abode in
man, that much-discussed &ldquo;social gospel?&rdquo;
Yet the following poem, not in
spite of but through its Catholic terminology,
heightens our realization of
brotherhood and dependence one upon
another. It is entitled <em>The Unknown
God</em>:
</p>

  </div>

<p class="noindent">
The spectacle of a general communion
again gives Mrs. Meynell inspiration for
a poem whose last two stanzas apply
equally as well to the secular, evolutionary
view of salvation as they do to the
ecclesiastical view, and whose last stanza
is most suggestive in the light it throws
upon the puzzling discrepancy between
the littleness of man and the unlimited
material vast in which he finds himself a
floating speck:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I saw this people as a field of flowers,</p>

      <p class="verse">Did no more than suffice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">

      <p class="verse">For each, the whole of the devoted sun.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Even so typically modern a philosopher
as Henri Bergson would find one of his
leading and rather baffling ideas beautifully
realized in one of Mrs. Meynell&rsquo;s
sonnets. Matter, Bergson tells us, in all
its manifestations is moulded by a spiritual
push from behind it, so that the sensible
world is not a mosaic of atoms obeying
fixed laws but rather a cosmic
compromise between matter and spirit, a
<em>modus vivendi</em> the operation of which
would seem very different to us were our
viewpoint that of pure spirit. Says Mrs.
Meynell in <em>To a Daisy</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Slight as thou art, thou art enough to hide</p>
        <p class="verse1">Like all created things, secrets from me,</p>
        <p class="verse1">And stand, a barrier to eternity.</p>
      <p class="verse">And I, how can I praise thee well and wide</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">From where I dwell&mdash;upon the hither side?</p>
        <p class="verse1">Thou little veil for so great mystery,</p>
        <p class="verse1">When shall I penetrate all things and thee,</p>
      <p class="verse">And then look back? For this I must abide,</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Till thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled</p>
      <p class="verse">Literally between me and the world.</p>
        <p class="verse1">Then I shall drink from in beneath a spring,</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">And from a poet&rsquo;s side shall read his book.</p>
      <p class="verse">O daisy mine, what shall it be to look</p>
      <p class="verse">From God&rsquo;s side even of such a simple thing?</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The sense of what might, perhaps, be
called restrained paradox in that sonnet,
is frequently met with in Mrs. Meynell&rsquo;s
writings, and it corresponds to aspects
of reality which the old religious phraseology
she has so freshly minted for us
is alone fitted to convey. <em>The Young
Neophyte</em> is a beautiful sonnet enshrining
the fatefulness of every human
action, the gift of the full flower which
is implicit in the gift of the smallest bud,
the preparation we are constantly making
for crises which are yet hidden in the
future. <em>Thoughts in Separation</em> also
deals with the paradoxical overcoming of
the handicaps of personal absence of our
friends through community of thought
and feeling. Not only are these paradoxes
in human psychology delicately
set forth by the poet, but those darker
ones of human work and destiny are consolingly
illuminated in such a poem as
<em>Builders of Ruins</em>&mdash;which does not depend
for its quality of consolation upon
anything foreign to its poetic truth.
</p>

<p>
One poem in the book is, perhaps,
most remarkable for the light it throws
upon the sense in which the term poetic
truth may be used, and as showing the
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
difference between the poetic, the realizable,
and, therefore, the true side of a
religion&mdash;the side Matthew Arnold was
so anxious to keep&mdash;and the mere theological
framework, always smelling of
unreality and always in need of renovation.
The poem may stand as a warning
against confusing real poetry&mdash;in
whose truth we need not be afraid to
trust because its author does not inhabit
our own thought world&mdash;with versified
theology. If all of Mrs. Meynell&rsquo;s work
were like her <em>Messina, 1908</em>, then the
critic and reader who now mistakenly
shun her would be right. And the poem
is a curious commentary upon Mr. Eastman&rsquo;s
insistence that poetry is realization.
For in her other poems the author
has presented those aspects of her religion
which are verifiable in experience.
Perhaps the quotations given above bear
out that point. But one aspect of religious
thought has now been pretty generally
abandoned, not because it has ever
been proven false, but because we have
never succeeded in realizing it for ourselves.
The God of orthodox church
theodicy never did &ldquo;make good&rdquo;;
Christ, the Saints, and even the very material
form of the cross itself had to
mediate between man and the divine.
And it is precisely in the one case in this
book where Mrs. Meynell tries to present
the governing rather than the immanent
God to us that she fails&mdash;as, if poetry
be realization, we should expect her to
fail. The first stanza of the poem addressed
to the Deity describes in a few
bold strokes the wreck of Messina, and
ends with the lines:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Destroyer, we have cowered beneath Thine own</p>
        <p class="verse1">Immediate unintelligible hand.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The second stanza describes the missions
of mercy to the stricken city, and
ends:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="verse1">... our shattered fingers feel</p>
      <p class="verse">Thy mediate and intelligible hand.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The essential weakness of this dependence
for poetic effect upon the two adjectives
and their negatives is no less
obvious than the weakness of the poet&rsquo;s
attribution of such apparently impulsive
and then retractatory conduct to a God
whose ways must either be explicable in
terms of a human sense of order or not
made the subject of human discourse at
all.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meynell describes herself in one
of these poems as a singer of a single
mood. Some of her critics have taken
her at her word and saved themselves
some trouble thereby in their task of
appreciation. But as a matter of fact,
she should not be taken at her own modest
estimate, for her one mood is such a
pervasive one, such a large and sane
mood, that it pays to look at more than
one aspect of life through its coloring.
And in truth, besides her better-known
poems which need no further mention
here, <em>The Lady Poverty</em> and <em>Renouncement</em>,
for example, there will be found
within the small compass of her beautifully-housed
collection of verse many
aspects of nature, all of them instinct
with a mystic shimmer of life, as well as
aspects of the innermost life of man
which it is given to few spirits to sing
in words&mdash;only, in fact, to those spirits
whose effort it is to make their poetry

<em>Euripides and His Age</em>, by Gilbert Murray. [Henry Holt and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> &ldquo;conspiracy of silence&rdquo; which
oppressed the youth of those of us who
were born in the late Victorian era never
seems more hateful than when some master
hand connects the present labors of
liberty with the strivings of the infinite
past. In some fashion the dominating
spirits of a generation ago contrived to
make the struggles for human freedom
appear as ugly isolated episodes without
precursors or ancestry. They forgot the
Shelleys and the Godwins and they even
denied the significance of the classic
forerunners of today&rsquo;s ardent prophets.
</p>

<p>
There were happy exceptions. Some
of us cherish the teachings of a Virginia
professor who, as far as the adolescent
capacities of his students permitted,
bridged the gap between Socrates&rsquo;s free
questionings and the contemporary
yearnings for a world of uncompromising
justice and beauty. What that
Southern student did for his small band
of followers Gilbert Murray has long
been doing for the great world. His
present contribution belongs to that
satisfying series, <em>The Home University
Library</em>. Incidentally, one reflects that
this <em>Home University</em> is one of the few
institutions of learning which has completely
avoided the blinders so many are
complacently wearing. The Euripides
of Murray suggests to the author&mdash;and
to the reader, one may claim&mdash;both
Tolstoi and Ibsen. But, one hastens to
state, Professor Murray is too learned
and thoughtful a man to paint a revolutionary
Euripides such as <em>The Masses</em>&mdash;much
as one loves that exuberant Don
Quixote&mdash;would delight to honor and to
portray. His onset, however, catches us:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Every man who possesses real vitality can
be seen as the resultant of two forces,&rdquo; says
Murray. &ldquo;He is first the child of a particular
age, society, convention; of what we may call in
one word a tradition. He is secondly, in one
degree or another, a rebel against that tradition.
And the best traditions make the best
rebels. Euripides is the child of a strong and
splendid tradition and is, together with Plato,
the fiercest of all rebels against it....
Euripides, like ourselves, comes in an age of
criticism, following upon an age of movement
and action. And for the most part, like ourselves,
he accepts the general standards on
which the movement and action were based. He
accepts the Athenian ideals of free thought,
free speech, democracy, &lsquo;virtue,&rsquo; and patriotism.
He arraigns his country because she
is false to them.&rdquo;
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
The suffragist and the feminist movements
have recently brought the great
dramatist to his proper appreciation in
respect to women. Some of the passages
in the <em>Medea</em> are quoted as often in suffragist
campaigns as the words of Bernard
Shaw or of Olive Schreiner. This
Greek is sometimes said to be the first
literary man who understood women.
For that reason, as Professor Murray so
charmingly emphasizes, Euripides was
ever accounted a woman hater, despite
even the implications of his great chorus
which sings so nobly woman&rsquo;s destined
rise as a power in the world. His statement
of the cause of barbarian woman
against a civilized man who has wronged
her is incomparably more contemporary
than <em>Madam Butterfly</em>, and with Murray
we may doubt &ldquo;if ever the deserted one
has found such words of fire as Medea
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
speaks.&rdquo; And, as the author continues,
&ldquo;Medea is not only a barbarian; she is
also a woman, and fights the horrible
war that lies, an eternally latent possibility,
between woman and man. Some
of the most profound and wounding
things said both by Medea and Jason
might almost be labelled in a book of
extracts &lsquo;Any Wife to Any Husband&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Any Husband to Any Wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The change which came over the spirit
of Euripides&rsquo;s vision, as Athens itself
was transformed by empire lust from the
first glories of Pericles, suggest again
the purifying satire of our ablest moderns.
War is hateful and the picture
which the Attic dramatist drew of the
horrors of dying Troy leave little to the
present imagination. Euripides accordingly
became as popular in imperialistic
Athens as was Bebel among the Kaiser&rsquo;s
ministers. Murray interprets this phase
magnificently. He concludes: &ldquo;This
scene, with the parting between Andromache
and the child which follows, seems
to me perhaps the most heartrending in
all the tragic literature of the world.
After rising from it one understands
Aristotle&rsquo;s judgment of Euripides as the
&lsquo;most tragic of the poets.&rsquo;&rdquo; One has
only to recall the brave gentleness of
Hector&rsquo;s wife, described first in Homeric
words, to agree with the present author.
</p>

<p>
On the purely critical side Professor
Murray&rsquo;s words are vastly important.
Especially valuable is his discussion of
the chorus and the <em>deus ex machina</em> concerning
which so much error has been
taught since Horace wrote on the art
of poetry. But this small book is not
designed for those whose interest in
Greek drama is technical. It is Euripides,
the philosopher; Euripides, the
satirist of his times; Euripides, the
preacher of lofty virtues, the apostle of
new men and more righteous gods, who
concerns the great awakening world of
1914. The intellectual battles which
Euripides fought on behalf of Athens
have been waged again and often for the
millions who slumber and are content.
They are being fought now with an intensity
unprecedented. So it brings
courage and it brings calm to realize
the continuity of the conflict, and to recall
the signal victories of the olden
days. Gilbert Murray&rsquo;s achievements
are too numerous to permit praise. One
may only say now that the present book
is in line with the fine things of his
past; that by virtue of his labors the
world agony for liberty and justice and
beauty reveals new phases of the intrinsic
dignity and honor which have been its
possession since men desired better
things.

Equal Suffrage: The First Real Test
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Henry Blackman Sell</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> query of the anti-suffragist&mdash;&ldquo;Will
the women really use suffrage
if they have it&rdquo;&mdash;was rather
conclusively answered in the affirmative
at Chicago aldermanic elections on April
7, when equal suffrage was given its first
real test in an American city of first
rank. This election brought out many
interesting incidents which might be considered
as having &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; value.
</p>

<p>
It has been contended by the &ldquo;antis&rdquo;
that the women would be bad losers;
that they would not support the non-partisan
ideals which are becoming a
definite part of our &ldquo;new patriotism&rdquo;;
that the result of equal suffrage would
simply be one of double vote, wives voting
as their husbands decided; that the
women coming out in the first enthusiasm
of registration would not take the
same interest in the prosaic work at the
polls; that the fights against bad nominees
would result either in a duplication
of man-run campaigns, or in ineffective
and lady-like campaigns.
</p>

<p>
The first of these contentions was
proved untrue to even the most casual
observer at the polls on election day.
The women were fighting uphill all the
way, and where the so-termed &ldquo;suffrage
men&rdquo; were slightly unpleasant in their
attitude towards the &ldquo;antis,&rdquo; the women
were all cheerfulness and all refreshing
encouragement. As one explained: &ldquo;It
has been the most wonderful feeling,
working shoulder to shoulder with the
men in something that has really been
our duty all along.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nine women candidates were up for
election and not one was chosen; and
yet, after talking with five defeated
women candidates and three defeated
men candidates, I concluded that the
women knew more about the philosophy
of politics and its sad uncertainties than
men who had been contesting for years.
</p>

<p>
True, election to office is but a by-product
of political experience; it is
a most coveted by-product, nevertheless,
and when a woman like Marion Drake,
who ran a close race against Chicago&rsquo;s
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; alderman, says, at the closing of
the polls, &ldquo;I have not been elected, but
every minute of the time I have expended
has been worth while and I shall try
again at the next election,&rdquo;&mdash;it shows
the right spirit and the fundamental
error in the assertion that women cannot
lose gracefully.
</p>

<p>
Non-partisanism could be given no
real test, for these ideals seemed necessary
of application in only two or three
wards. In one&mdash;the twenty-first&mdash;an
alderman with a bad record was up for
re-election in opposition to a Republican
of no particular merit. The women got
together, with the aid of some of the
better men, and selected a non-partisan
candidate. This man was elected directly
through the efforts of the women who,
Republican, Democratic, and Progressive,
rallied in true non-partisan spirit
to his aid.
</p>

<p>
As to the control of the women&rsquo;s votes
by the men: it is interesting to note
that in the more intelligent wards there
was considerable variance between the
men and the women, while in the wards
of the poorer and less intellectually-inclined
portions of the city the votes
ran a great deal alike.
</p>

<p>
The women came out in good numbers
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
and, as a matter of fact, the masculine
vote was considerably higher than usual;
but even with this advantage, the registered
women outvoted the registered
men by a small per cent.
</p>

<p>
The campaigns conducted by the various
women were distinctly different from
the ordinary political campaigns. They
were dignified, straightforward, strong,
and effective. Miss Drake, in her campaign
against John Coughlin, colloquially
and delicately known as &ldquo;Bathhouse
John,&rdquo;&mdash;the name originating from the
fact that the gentleman in question received
his political training as a mopper
and rubber in one of Chicago&rsquo;s most
infamous bath houses,&mdash;made a direct
appeal, in a house to house, voter to
voter, canvass of her ward. In this
way she told over two-thirds of the
people of the &ldquo;Bathhouse&rsquo;s&rdquo; territory
all about the gentleman, his ambitions,
his desires, and his insidious motives.
And while she was defeated, it must be
remembered that though Coughlin received
a sufficient plurality, he by no
means attained his boast:&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat
that skirt by 8,000 votes.&rdquo; In fact,
where his plurality at the last elections
was approximately eight to one, this
year it was less than two-and-a-half to
one, making an obvious deduction that
Miss Drake&rsquo;s campaign was decidedly
successful even though she did not win.

<span class="firstchar">F</span><span class="postfirstchar">rench,</span> Italian, English, Greek, and
German at the age of nine, a Ph.D. degree
at fourteen, a doctor of laws and
an appointment to the teaching staff of
the Berlin University at sixteen&mdash;these
were some of the achievements of Karl
Witte. Or shall I say of pastor Witte,
the father? For the boy had very little
to do with it: he was merely a piece of
putty in the able hands of a strong-willed
man who knew what he wanted and
how to get it. A child of ordinary abilities,
according to pastor Witte and others,
Karl absorbed an enormous amount
of knowledge in a comparatively short
time, as a result of a method of education
which began almost as soon as he
showed intelligence.
</p>

<p>
The book, originally written about one
hundred years ago when scientific advice
on the subject was lacking, is a remarkable
document. It is full of useful information
and practical hints to parents
and people interested in the education of
children, even in this day of scientific
methods and conflicting authorities. But
as we might have expected, the discipline
reminds us a little of the German
&ldquo;Kaserne.&rdquo; The spilling of a little milk
on the tablecloth was punished by enforced
abstinence from all foods except
bread and salt. Punishment as a remedy
for an offense is always wrong, because
it does not prove the responsibility
of the act to the child.
</p>

<p>
The spirit in which pastor Witte went
about his task is shown in the following
passage:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
The firmness in executing my purpose went
so far that even our house dog knew the emphasis
of the words: &ldquo;I must work,&rdquo; and
calmed down the moment we spoke these words
softly into his ears. Almost from the outset
this made an enormous impression on Karl. He
soon became accustomed to look upon his work
time as something sacred.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
The development of intellectual and
moral courage, the most important qualities
any man or woman may possess,
were neglected, at least were not given
the attention they deserve. To inculcate
in the child a desire for liberty and social
equality, he overlooks entirely.
</p>

<p>
The father is really the more remarkable
of the two. A product of the method
of education prevailing at the time,
he stands as a refutation of his own theories.
Pastor Witte conceived and carried
out an idea successfully. He did
something, at least theoretically, worth
while. The son died at eighty-three.
Now what difference would it have
made either to the boy or to the world if
his appointment to the teaching staff of
Berlin had come at a later date? Most
methods of education aim at the training
of the senses and the accumulation of
facts. While these are necessary, I think
the speed at which this is done is immaterial
to the child.
</p>

<p>
Some of the finest men and women,
who made this a better world to live in,
had no scientific training in their childhood
or later. We need not go back to
history to find them. Maxime Gorky,
for instance, lost his parents before he
was four years old, and began to read
under the supervision of a cook at sixteen.
Jack London is another instance
that suggests itself readily to one&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
Of course these are exceptional people,
but take the thousands of able and
brainy men and women in labor organizations
and idealists in all walks of life.
Usually they had very little attention
from their parents, either because they
had no time or did not know enough.
These men and women who had to rub up
against the rough edges of our money-making
machinery and to stand squarely
on their feet facing this world and its
problems,&mdash;willing to lend a hand, yes,
even to give their lives for the betterment
of social and economic conditions&mdash;these
persons are worthy of the name.
</p>

<p>
Now I don&rsquo;t want to say anything
against the early training of children.
The kindergarten and all the methods of
early training in schools have come into
existence because there is a real need for
them. Parents, for many reasons, no
longer have the time to train their own
children; but we expect results from
education in general that cannot be
accomplished.
</p>

<p>
What good are all the learning and
scientific facts that we have accumulated
up to now, if we don&rsquo;t use them to make
our life richer and more beautiful?
Knowledge and ability are worthless if
there is no moral and intellectual courage
to back them up. Pastor Witte
thought the education of his son finished
when he reached the age of sixteen.
We today do things in the same spirit.
We get things done. Nothing slow
about us. The result, of course, is very
poor; nobody is satisfied. Our experts,
always ready with advice on any and
everything, tell us that what we need is
technical training to provide industry
with efficient help. These educators do
not see that the difficulty is not with
the child but with industrial conditions.
They are going to fit the child to this
misery called modern industry. But remove
the possibility of the unscrupulous
taking advantage of the inexperienced
and simple-minded, and many of the so-called
educational problems will disappear.

A New-Old Tagore Play
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Chitra: A Play in One Act</em>, by Rabindranath Tagore.
[The Macmillan Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">N</span><span class="postfirstchar">othing</span> is more irritating to a really
modern critic than to have to join in a
chorus of universal praise. It is particularly
irritating when the person acclaimed
is a Nobel prize winner, for surely
those of us who sit in private judgment
in secluded places ought to be able
to discern values subtler than the ones
open to the eyes of some mysterious
frock-coated and silk-hatted jury of professors
in Stockholm, or wherever it may
be. The very marrow in the bones of
criticism curdles at the thought of agreeing
with a popular award.
</p>

<p>
But a certain native honesty and a distinct
desire to spread good news obliges
one, in the case of <em>Chitra</em>, to withhold
the amiable dissecting knife. The play
is far too beautiful to serve as a cadaver
for the illustration of either the anatomist&rsquo;s
skill or the facts of anatomy. Let
it be confessed that this reviewer, who
was about to send the book back with a
refusal to review any work of Tagore,
found, after reading a few lines, that he
was forced to go on; and that having
once gone on, he preferred to write the
review rather than to give up the book.
</p>

<p>
This play was written twenty-five
years ago, and belongs, therefore, to
that earlier strata of Tagore&rsquo;s life which
is to the normal mind so much more
alluring than the latter detritus that
seems to have accumulated over him. His
later work appears to be old with the old
age of Asia and with the old age of himself.
Its fundamental feeling is the only
too familiar impulse to recline on the
bosom of a remote God. We who regard
this attitude as a perversion of manhood
will turn from it with relief to the earlier
writing, in which the very life-blood of
our own hearts seems quivering with
the intimations of a better-than-godlike
beauty.
</p>

<p>
As I have suggested, there is very
little that can rationally be said about
this play <em>Chitra</em>. To indicate something
of the nature of so perfect a work is the
sole office that I can profitably perform.
</p>

<p>
Chitra, daughter of a King who had
no sons, was brought up to live the life
and perform the activities of a man, with
a man&rsquo;s hardness of frame and a man&rsquo;s
directness of will. One day while hunting
in the forest, she found sleeping in
her path Arjuna, the great warrior of
the Kuru Clan. &ldquo;Then for the first time
in my life I felt myself a woman, and
knew that a man was before me....&rdquo;
Going to the gods of love, Chitra obtained
from them the gift of a perfect
and world-vanquishing beauty to last for
one year only; and returning to Arjuna
she overcame by this invincible weapon
the monastic vows which he had taken
upon himself, and swept him away into
the wild and glorious current of her year
of beauty. Thus the year begins:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="speaker">
<em>Chitra</em>
</p>

<p>
At evening I lay down on a grassy bed
strewn with the petals of spring flowers, and
recollected the wonderful praise of my beauty
I had heard from Arjuna;&mdash;drinking drop by
drop the honey that I had stored during the
long day. The history of my past life, like
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
that of my former existences, was forgotten. I
felt like a flower, which has but a few fleeting
hours to listen to all the humming of the
woodlands and then must lower its eyes from
the sky, bend its head, and at a breath give
itself up to the dust without a cry, thus ending
the short story of a perfect moment that has
neither past nor future.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Vasanta</em> (The God of Love)
</p>

<p>
A limitless life of glory can bloom and spend
itself in a morning.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Madana</em> (The God of the Seasons)
</p>

<p>
Like an endless meaning in the narrow span
of a song.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Chitra</em>
</p>

<p>
The southern breeze caressed me to sleep.
From the flowering <em>malati</em> bower overhead
silent kisses dropped over my body. On my
hair, my breast, my feet, each flower chose a
bed to die on. I slept. And suddenly, in the
depth of my sleep, I felt as if some intense
eager look, like tapering fingers of flame,
touched my slumbering body. I started up and
saw the Hermit standing before me. The moon
had moved to the west, peering through the
leaves to espy this wonder of divine art wrought
in a fragile human frame. The air was heavy
with perfume; the silence of the night was
vocal with the chirping of crickets; the reflections
of the trees hung motionless in the lake;
and with his staff in his hand he stood, tall
and straight and still, like a forest tree. It
seemed to me that I had, on opening my eyes,
died to all realities of life and undergone a
dream birth into a shadow land. Shame slipped
to my feet like loosened clothes. I heard his
call&mdash;&ldquo;Beloved, my most beloved!&rdquo; And all
my forgotten lives united as one and responded
to it. I said, &ldquo;Take me, take all I am!&rdquo; And
I stretched out my arms to him. The moon set
behind the trees. Heaven and earth, time and
space, pleasure and pain, death and life merged
together in an unbearable ecstasy.... With
the first gleam of light, the first twitter of
birds, I rose up and sat leaning on my left
arm. He lay asleep with a vague smile about
his lips like the crescent moon in the morning.
The rosy-red glow of the dawn fell upon his
noble forehead. I sighed and stood up. I
drew together the leafy lianas to screen the
streaming sun from his face. I looked about
me and saw the same old earth. I remembered
what I used to be, and ran and ran like a deer
afraid of her own shadow, through the forest
path strewn with <em>shephali</em> flowers. I found a
lonely nook, and sitting down covered my face
with both hands, and tried to weep and cry.
But no tears came to my eyes.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Madana</em>
</p>

<p>
Alas, thou daughter of mortals! I stole
from the divine storehouse the fragrant wine
of heaven, filled with it one earthly night to the
brim, and placed it in thy hand to drink&mdash;yet
still I hear this cry of anguish!...
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
A few words, a half dozen pages of
prose modulated to perform an office as
subtle as that of blank verse, give us the
exquisite essence of the year that follows;
and toward the end there steal into
it notes of the inadequacy which the
great warrior feels in this perfection, and
his desire for the old and harsher round
of human life. Thus the year ends:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="speaker">
<em>Madana</em>
</p>

<p>
Tonight is thy last night.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Vasanta</em>
</p>

<p>
The loveliness of your body will return tomorrow
to the inexhaustible stores of the spring.
The ruddy tint of thy lips, freed from the
memory of Arjuna&rsquo;s kisses, will bud anew as
a pair of fresh asoka leaves, and the soft,
white glow of thy skin will be born again in
a hundred fragrant jasmine flowers.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Chitra</em>
</p>

<p>
O gods, grant me this my prayer! Tonight,
in its last hour, let my beauty flash its brightest,
like the final flicker of a dying flame.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Madana</em>
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt have thy wish.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
And as it ends, and as Chitra realizes
that there is to fall from her that radiance
which has been, for a year, the sole
bond between her and her lover, and also
the sole barrier between the real her and
him, she finds that his profounder longing
has changed into a desire for the
companionship of that strong and eager
boy-woman that she was before her
transformation.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="speaker">
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
<em>Chitra</em> (<em>cloaked</em>)
</p>

<p>
My lord, has the cup been drained to the
last drop? Is this indeed the end? No; when
all is done something still remains, and that is
my last sacrifice at your feet.
</p>

<p>
I brought from the garden of heaven flowers
of incomparable beauty with which to worship
you, god of my heart. If the rites are over, if
the flowers have faded, let me throw them out
of the temple (<em>unveiling in her original male
attire</em>). Now, look at your worshipper with
gracious eyes.
</p>

<p>
I am not beautifully perfect as the flowers
with which I worshipped. I have many flaws
and blemishes. I am a traveller in the great
world-path, my garments are dirty, and my
feet are bleeding with thorns. Where should I
achieve flower-beauty, the unsullied loveliness of
a moment&rsquo;s life? The gift that I proudly bring
you is the heart of a woman. Here have all
pains and joys gathered, the hopes and fears
and shames of a daughter of the dust; here love
springs up struggling toward immortal life.
Herein lies an imperfection which yet is noble
and grand. If the flower-service is finished, my
master, accept this as your servant for the days
to come!
</p>

<p>
I am Chitra, the king&rsquo;s daughter. Perhaps
you will remember the day when a woman came
to you in the temple of Shiva, her body loaded
with ornaments and finery. That shameless
woman came to court you as though she were a
man. You rejected her; you did well. My
lord, I am that woman. She was my disguise.
Then by the boon of gods I obtained for a
year the most radiant form that a mortal ever
wore, and wearied my hero&rsquo;s heart with the
burden of that deceit. Most surely I am not
that woman.
</p>

<p>
I am Chitra. No goddess to be worshipped,
nor yet the object of common pity to be brushed
aside like a moth with indifference. If you
deign to keep me by your side in the path of
danger and daring, if you allow me to share the
great duties of your life, then you will know
my true self. If your babe, whom I am nourishing
in my womb, be born a son, I shall myself
teach him to be a second Arjuna, and send him
to you when the time comes, and then at last
you will truly know me. Today I can only
offer you Chitra, the daughter of a king.
</p>

<p class="speaker">
<em>Arjuna</em>
</p>

<p>
Beloved, my life is full.

An Unorthodox View of Burroughs
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Our Friend John Burroughs</em>, by Clara Barrus.
[Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> title engenders a resentment in
me, a sense of unfitness. It is an epitome
of a popular approval which has cheapened
the word &ldquo;friendship.&rdquo; If Walt
Whitman, John Muir, and Francis F.
Browne had jointly written of Burroughs,
the words &ldquo;our friend&rdquo; in the
title of their collaboration would have
been inevitable and nice. The common
disregard of so unimportant a matter as
this seems to be in the author&rsquo;s opinion
exhibits the crass liberties which the public
is wont to take with personalities.
The result is that a great man may become
popular and useful before he is
understood.
</p>

<p>
Burroughs happily is both read and
understood. His popularity therefore is
wholesome. But the mild and consistent
protest which his life has been and is
against the necessary artificialities in
which most of his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; live has
never drawn them into a comprehending,
practicing sympathy with it. He is read,
applauded, and envied&mdash;but not followed.
His softness and gentle unconcern
with affairs are the antitheses of
those dynamic qualities which confer
leadership and vitalize men&rsquo;s impulses
and deeds. His urban admirers go to
the country to rusticate and picnic but
not to live a life like his. He does too
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
much speculative thinking to give his attitude
toward the world an opportunity
to go home to his readers.
</p>

<p>
Whitman, with a similar indifference
to a following, drives men into the open
road; Thoreau lures them to Walden
Ponds to repeat his experiment; Ik Marvel
persuades them to farm; David
Grayson charms city folk back to the
land, to anchor and live. Burroughs attracts
visitors to Slabsides. He is on the
verge of becoming an institution, a curiosity.
His life has been a personal success.
He is young in spirit and surprisingly
robust at nearly eighty years of
age&mdash;he is seventy-seven this month&mdash;and
I daresay that his obvious failure to
lead his readers towards country homes
of their own or seriously to interest them
in the art of simple living has never
given him the slightest pain. He has assumed
no responsibility for the ways of
the world. Nature is capable of working
out her own salvation during a future
eternity. A leaf on a tree does not quarrel
with or attempt to reform its personal
kin. It functions alone; the life
of which it is a part must take care of
horticultural sociology. Burroughs to
me acknowledges himself to be a leaf on
the great tree. That is exceedingly interesting;
but endow leaves with reason,
give them an expanding consciousness,
and their functions must change. Burroughs
would require to be more than a
predestinated leaf if his fellows were
leaves.
</p>

<p>
By virtue of society&rsquo;s struggle and industry,
in which Burroughs is not interested,
he has made of the world, so far as
he is concerned, a quiet, beautiful outdoor
cathedral, domed by the sky, its
chief priest being fed and clothed by the
slaves of productive industry in your
world and mine. With great respect and
admiration I pronounce him a sagacious
man, a clever leaf that has employed its
reason with remarkable personal advantage.
In Burroughs&rsquo; world the tragedies,
strife, and noise that we experience
do not exist; his cathedral is a by-product
and he is a modest beneficiary of
humanity&rsquo;s work. In relation to the
masses of people it is as unreal as it is
unproductive of racial fitness to persist
in the world as most men know it. He
loves to dream, think, and write in his
cathedral; what is going on outside does
not disturb him. He revels in the leisure,
order, and security which the outsiders
have provided. He assures us that it is
pleasant and satisfying, and we honor
and reward him for the information, but
I should like to ask him whether the
largest freedom and selfhood that are
achievable apart from working, conflicting,
warring men are not themselves fundamentally
artificial.
</p>

<p>
Burroughs does not seem to be sufficiently
alive to suspect that he has missed
something greater than personal contentment.
A reader of everything that
he has published, I never, until I read the
autobiographical sketches in this work,
felt the pity and unsocial contempt&mdash;not
for the man but for the type&mdash;which
I have here tried to express.

Another Masefield Tragedy
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Tragedy of Pompey the Great</em>, by John Masefield.
[The Macmillan Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">C</span><span class="postfirstchar">reative</span> artist that he is, Masefield
moves forward into amazing clearness,
heightened by flashes of poetic light, the
scenes of nearly two thousand years ago
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
in Rome. The fidelity of this tragedy to
the facts of history, and the remarkable
extent to which it reproduces the overwhelming
glory of a great struggle, are
new proofs of the author&rsquo;s special affinity
with the sanguinary deeds of heroic
men. Masefield&rsquo;s plays and narrative
poems give the element of tragedy something
of its old vividness and nobility in
art. Some of his phrases sound like the
fall of a guillotine. He is a master of
the magic of objectifying tremendous
unrealities. He hates feeble passions;
wanton courage and oaken physical
power in action are the big things that
he likes to ennoble with poetic treatment.
And his success is incomparable, so far
as his contemporaries are concerned.
</p>

<p>
Masefield&rsquo;s great characters, true to
the glossed facts of life, in crises exhibit
indwelling cave-men. His frankness and
honesty are themselves tragical. Life <em>is</em>
full of and inseparable from tragedy.
Pompey &ldquo;saw a madman in Egypt. He
was eyeless with staring at the sun. He
said that ideas come out of the East,
like locusts. They settle on the nations
and give them life; and then pass on,
dying, to the wilds, to end in some scratch
on a bone, by a cave-man&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo; The
old warrior lies awake, thinking. &ldquo;What
are we?&rdquo; he asks Lucceius, and that
actor in a great play replies, &ldquo;Who
knows? Dust with a tragic purpose.
Then an end.&rdquo; Masefield surveys the
recorded history of the past, sees into
the heart of the present and exclaims,
&ldquo;Tragedy!&rdquo; And of course that is in
his own life; otherwise he could not see
it apart from himself. In sheer desperation
he endues dust with a &ldquo;tragic purpose,&rdquo;
but he does not believe so much as
he hopes that a &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; inheres in
that resultant of life, for in the big poem
with which he summarizes the record of
Pompey he says:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

<p class="noindent">
<em>The Tragedy of Pompey the Great</em>,
unlike any Shaw play or even <em>The Tragedy
of Nan</em>, is not good reading; its
short sentences, tragic with import, are
mere outlines. But they drive incarnate
reality into one&rsquo;s soul.
</p>

<p>
What was the tragedy of Pompey?
Well, it began hundreds of years before
he was born; he was the accidental embodiment
of it. He had earned security
and peace. He had aided Caesar in conquering
Gaul. &ldquo;Caesar would never
have been anybody if Pompey hadn&rsquo;t
backed him.&rdquo; But that tyrant&rsquo;s lust for
power provoked a civil war, and the end
was &ldquo;a blind, turbulent heaving towards
freedom.&rdquo; Pompey&rsquo;s dream of freedom&mdash;his
conviction that power was in too
few hands&mdash;cost him his life. To him
Rome was inwardly &ldquo;a great democratic
power struggling with obsolete laws.&rdquo;
He declared that &ldquo;Rome must be settled.
The crowd must have more power.&rdquo; But
Pompey&rsquo;s dream was shallow and human,
even if great, for, regarding the
&ldquo;thought of the world&rdquo; as of transcendent
importance, he asks, &ldquo;For what else
are we fighting but to control the
thought of the world? What else
matters?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
History seems to try to repeat itself.
Lentulus, fearing that they were losing
Rome, said to Pompey, &ldquo;You have done
nothing.&rdquo; The reply&mdash;&ldquo;Wait&rdquo;&mdash;has
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
a modern sound. Pompey was preparing
to fight Caesar, but public opinion,
voiced by Metellus, excitedly demanded,
&ldquo;but at once. Give him no time to win
recruits by success. Give them no time
here. The rabble don&rsquo;t hesitate. They
don&rsquo;t understand a man who hesitates.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That too might have been said by a
modern American newspaper, affecting to
speak for the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Philip, beloved of the maiden Antistia,
is fanatically true to his master, whom
he would follow &ldquo;To the desert. To the
night without stars. To the wastes of
the seas. To the two-forked flame.&rdquo; To
him this blind devotion meant more than
Antistia&rsquo;s love. &ldquo;We shall have to put
off our marriage,&rdquo; he said to her, and
she, speaking from the deep heart of the
mother, unachieved, answered:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Why, thus it is. We put off and put off till
youth&rsquo;s gone, and strength&rsquo;s gone, and beauty&rsquo;s
gone. Till we two dry sticks mumble by the
fire together, wondering what there was in life,
when the sap ran.... When you kiss the dry
old hag, Philip, you&rsquo;ll remember these arms
that lay wide on the bed, waiting, empty.
Years. You&rsquo;ll remember this beauty. All this
beauty. That would have borne you sons but
for your master.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Whatever the fate of Pompey, Antistia&rsquo;s
was the supreme tragedy.

<p class="noindent">
There&rsquo;s something very much like that
small person in a decidedly larger person
called H. G. Wells. For all the great
sweep and astonishing convincingness of
his later novels he still keeps the child-like
quality of asking startling questions
about everything in the universe. He
still wants to know: &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I catch
the sun, and what would happen if I
did?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In his last half dozen novels he has
been asking about various phases of our
modern society, politics, and the sex
question. But in this latest book, <em>The
World Set Free</em>, he goes back to a type
of question that interested him some
years ago, the type half fanciful and
half sociological that produced <em>In the
Days of the Comet</em>, <em>The Time Machine</em>,
and <em>When the Sleeper Wakes</em>. But this
book is not entirely like the earlier ones.
For one thing the science is for the first
time so nearly possible that it is almost
probable, and for another this book is
the work of an older, quieter soul with
less regard for externals and with more
faith in the ultimate high hope for mankind.
</p>

<p>
What Wells has asked himself this
time is: &ldquo;What would happen if man
were suddenly given command over an
unlimited amount of physical power?&rdquo;
He brings this about by modern chemistry.
A scientist discovers a new theory
of matter which enables him to break
down metals by radio-activity and so
generate practically limitless power. The
first use the world makes of this power
is to go to war. We can hardly quarrel
with Wells for the improbability of this
because it sweeps the board so clear for
his reconstruction period, which is the
heart of the story.
</p>

<p>
A strange story it is; one whose hero
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
is mankind&mdash;mankind in the bulk, groping,
struggling, trying half blindly to
adapt himself to the new conditions, and
at last, after a desperate period of reconstruction,
coming out into the sunlight,
triumphant, clean, and at peace. Now
and then an individual is caught up for
an instant into the story, transfigured
for the moment by circumstances into a
mouthpiece for the mass of mankind,&mdash;a
scientist, a middle-class Englishman who
wrote his memoirs, the Slavic Fox, a
dying prophet of the later age,&mdash;but
for the most part it is just mankind who
speaks. Wells, by the great sweep and
vision of his ideas and the almost super-human
handling of the technical difficulties
of such an impersonal story, succeeds
in raising us for a moment out of
our personal selves so that we are completely
identified with the race, and view
its later successes with a serene and personal
pride.
</p>

<p>
Each of us becomes a link in the great
chain of humanity that reaches from the
cave man through the &ldquo;chuckle-headed
youth&rdquo; to the dying professor, the men
who dreamed of snaring the sun in a net
and taming it to their hand. &ldquo;Ye auld
red thing ...&rdquo; we say with the chuckle-headed
youth, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you <em>yet</em>!&rdquo;
And the dying prophet cries for each
of us to the setting orb:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;Old Sun, I gather myself together out of
the pools of the individual that have held me
dispersed so long. I gather my billion thoughts
into science and my million wills into a common
purpose. Well may you slink down behind the
mountain from me, well may you cower....&rdquo;

A $10,000 Novel
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Diane of the Green Van</em>, by Leona Dalrymple.
[The Reilly and Britton Company, Chicago.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">bout</span> the middle of last December
Mr. F. K. Reilly sent a telegram to a
Miss Leona Dalrymple of Passaic, New
Jersey, in which he asked: &ldquo;May I call
upon you Thursday afternoon?&rdquo; The
telegram was the result of the $10,000
prize contest which the Reilly and Britton
Company had planned early in the
year; and Miss Dalrymple had just been
announced as the winner by the three
judges&mdash;S. S. McClure, Ida Tarbell,
and George N. Madison. She knew nothing
of this, however, though she thought
Mr. Reilly&rsquo;s telegram must mean an interest
in her work; so she replied calmly
that she would be pleased to see him on
Thursday. Then Mr. Reilly&rsquo;s eyes begin
to twinkle, as he tells the story, for it is
rather a joke to set out on a journey
with a $10,000 check in your pocket for
an unsuspecting young woman. Even
when he explained to her and presented
the check she remained calm&mdash;though
she is only twenty-eight years old and
this was her first taste of real fame. She
told Mr. Reilly that she had another
novel which she hoped might interest
him&mdash;but he took the words out of her
mouth by saying that he had come prepared
to make a contract for it!
</p>

<p>
So much for the latest of modern
fairy tales. <em>Diane of the Green Van</em>
is the prize-winning novel, and, despite
our first suspicion of it because of that
very fact, it proves to be a good one.
Miss Dalrymple loves the outdoors, and
her present story of an American girl
who goes jaunting in a van in the
Florida Everglades was suggested by a
newspaper clipping about an adventurous
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
young Englishwoman who managed
to break away from conventions once a
year and roam the country in a gipsy
wagon. Not all &ldquo;best sellers&rdquo; have as
much real charm as this one. Perhaps
its freshness and spontaneity are due to
the fact that it had to be written in six
weeks for the contest.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dalrymple has stated that her
purpose in writing novels is to &ldquo;entertain
wholesomely through optimism and
romance.&rdquo; Usually that type of purpose
is linked up with a sentimentality which
means being sweet at the expense of
truth. But this author is not that sort:
in expressing her dislike of sex stories,
for instance, she attributes their shortcomings
to treatment, not to material&mdash;&ldquo;since
there is absolutely no subject
under the sun which may not be treated
with perfect good taste in a novel.&rdquo; She
has also stated that in her opinion the
modern woman is over-sexed&mdash;a popular
though altogether wrong-headed view
which we mean some time to argue with
her in these columns.

Slime and the Breath of Life
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Russian Novel</em>, translated from the French of Le Vicomte E. M. de Vogüe by Colonel H.
A. Sawyer.
[George H. Doran Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">lthough</span> this book was written in
1886, its treatments of Pushkin, Gogol,
Turgeneff, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy
are now first made accessible to the English
reader, and will still be worth his
attention. In fact one reads them with a
growing regret that the author, who died
in 1910, did not continue his interpretation
of the Russian spirit as the religious
and mystic tone of its nihilism gradually
faded and left us the bleaker outlook
of such men as Gorky. With Tolstoy,
however&mdash;&ldquo;probably the greatest
demonstrator of life which has arisen
since Goethe&rdquo;&mdash;the book closes.
</p>

<p>
The author treats his subject from the
standpoint of a certain formula which he
finds to hold throughout the range of
that realism which succeeded the romanticism
of Pushkin&mdash;a romanticism which
disappeared in 1840. Thereafter there
grew up the great realistic school which
gives Russia the leadership of the world
in the field of realistic fiction&mdash;a leadership
due partly to the temperamental
standpoint of the Russian, adapted for
just the kind of work which the great
realistic novel involves, and partly to the
importance of the novel as the vehicle of
those ideas which the censor barred from
every other channel of expression.
</p>

<p>
In the bible we are told that God made
man out of the slime of the earth and
breathed into him the breath of life. In
those words is the secret of the Russian
realistic novel. For the realism of his
own country the author of this work has
little praise. Because, he says, it lacked
that human sympathy which saw in man
not only the slime of the earth but the
breath of life, it is barren.
</p>

<p>
Dickens, on the other hand, and
George Eliot gave to English realism a
standpoint which was moulded, nay, impregnated
through and through, with
the religion of that book to which Mary
Evans had renounced formal allegiance&mdash;the
Protestant bible. In fact, De
Vogüe goes so far as to say that some of
her writing, for instance &ldquo;the meeting
between Dinah and Lisbeth,&rdquo; is biblical
in the quality of its appeal, and might
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
have been written by the hand that gave
us <em>Ruth</em>.
</p>

<p>
This spirit, but without the Anglo-Saxon
hardness, is the spirit of Russian
realism. It has all the photographic accuracy,
the preocupation with all types
of life that distinguishes French realism;
but the preoccupation with the divine,
the mystical turning away from the
things of this world, is also present. The
sympathy of Gogol is intensified to painfulness
in Dostoevsky and is apotheosized
into a new religion of renunciation
in Tolstoy.
</p>

<p>
And because (in contrast to the
French) the Russians &ldquo;disentangled
themselves from these excesses, and like
the English gave realism a superior
beauty moved by the same moral spirit
of a compassion cleansed of all impurities
and glorified by the spirit of the gospels&rdquo;&mdash;because
of this De Vogüe regards
Russian realistic literature as the
one force that can rejuvenate the literary
art of the European nations.
</p>

<p>
The author writes with the authority
of long study and gives us a sufficient
basis for what we must now do ourselves&mdash;namely,
read comtemporary
Russian literature and ask ourselves
what it tells us; whether or not it tells us
that Christian realism is a contradiction
in terms.

A Drama of the Two Generations
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Nowadays: A Contemporaneous Comedy in Three Acts</em>, by George Middleton.
[Henry Holt and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">ome</span> little theatre company ought to
send eight of its members on tour
through all the smaller cities of the country
in <em>Nowadays</em>. It would be the most
effective way in the world to awaken the
people of those slumbering places to the
really amazing revolutions in contemporary
life&mdash;and incidentally in the
contemporary theatre. For one thing, it
shows how parents and children are
gradually bridging the foolish gulf between
the generations&mdash;the gulf that
Shaw has called the degrading objection
of youth to age; for another, it reflects
the extraordinary renaissance that
has come to our theatre since the first
visit of the Irish Players.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Middleton takes a typical small-town
family&mdash;a father, mother, son,
and daughter&mdash;and leads them through
a domestic crisis that has probably been
the sad lot of most modern families. The
daughter, like all proper young women,
has an ambition: she wants to be a
sculptor. The mother understands, having
had similar longings before she married
a man who made it his business to
suppress them. The father refuses to
listen to the daughter&rsquo;s idea, and tells
her that if she goes to New York it will
be without his help. But she goes; and
the play opens with her first visit home.
The son, a weakling without ability of
any sort except to spend money and sow
wild oats, has also left home; but he has
managed to live very comfortably because
of a monthly allowance from his
father. The justice of the situation
harks back to the antique theory that
even a weak boy has more right to the
splendors of the world than a girl of
any type.
</p>

<p>
Diana&rsquo;s father refuses to think about
woman suffrage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to think
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
about something I <em>feel</em>. I tell you, if we
had woman suffrage, women would all
vote like their husbands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say it would double the ignorant
vote,&rdquo; answers Diana&rsquo;s friend, Peter,
the journalist, who has encouraged her
in rebelling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good-natured old fossil,&rdquo;
Peter says later to Diana. And when the
girl insists that she loves her father anyhow,
Peter says, &ldquo;I love radishes, but
they don&rsquo;t agree with me. If he had a
new idea he&rsquo;d die of dropsy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The result of Diana&rsquo;s visit is to produce
certain rebellions in her mother,
who goes back to New York with her to
help make a home of that lonely little
flat, and to revive her own early ambitions
as a painter. Later the father succumbs
to the new order. It is all good &ldquo;comedy&rdquo;;
also it&rsquo;s tremendously good thinking.
If only it could be read by all the
people who misunderstand the surging
modern spirit that is riding so bravely
through traditions and inheritances.
</p>

<p>
But <em>Nowadays</em> has another value besides
that of its story. It is made of the
stuff of the new drama; it fulfills our demand
that the theatre shall give us the
truth about life in a simple way. However,
we shall talk more about this in
another issue.

Our Mr. Wrenn and Us
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Our Mr. Wrenn</em>, by Sinclair Lewis.
[Harper and Brothers, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> poverty of American workaday
criticism has rarely shown more threadbare
than in the fact that of all the reviews
of <em>Our Mr. Wrenn</em>, a first novel
by Sinclair Lewis, a new author, not one
has mentioned the idea under the book.
</p>

<p>
They have been good reviews, too, as
reviews go. Many have praised the book,
have talked around it, described its characters,
attempted to classify it&mdash;under
names so various as Locke, Wells, and
Dickens. Yet so expected is the novel
that means nothing, and so dead is critical
vision, that no one has thought to
say &ldquo;Here is a new American writer.
What is in his soul?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Let me prove the point. &ldquo;Our Mr.
Wrenn&rdquo; is a mouse-like little clerk in the
office of a New York novelty company.
He is called &ldquo;Our Mr. Wrenn&rdquo; in business
correspondence by the manager of
the firm. He is overshadowed by &ldquo;the
job.&rdquo; He lives uncomfortably in Mrs.
Zapp&rsquo;s downtown boarding house. Because
the author can see, various figures
from the drab stream one meets in the
street are made human. Because the
author has whimsicality and scorn and
sympathy, the book has humor and satire
and pathos. All these things have been
noted by the critics.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wrenn is not always &ldquo;Our.&rdquo; He
becomes his own in the gorgeously illustrated
travel leaflets sent out by steamship
companies. Eventually he does go
to England on a cattle steamer. He is
&ldquo;Bill Wrenn&rdquo; and licks a tough. He
meets adventures&mdash;Istra, an over-fine
artist girl who likes him because he&rsquo;s
real. In the end he pathetically sees her
soar above him and sails back to America,
where he goes into the office again, falls
in love with a sweet little lingerie-counter
clerk, marries, and &ldquo;settles down.&rdquo; All
these things the critics have told us.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Wrenn is at once glorious
and pathetic, not only because he says
&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; when he has the emotions of a
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
poet. It isn&rsquo;t only the little things of
the book that twist our smiles.
</p>

<p>
There is an epic conflict between Mr.
Wrenn of the job and Bill Wrenn of the
sunsets and the sea. Our Mr. Wrenn,
oppressed and bullied, scuttling out of
the way, not quite daring to think his
own thoughts or dream his own dreams,
not knowing quite enough to understand
the great things of the world&mdash;this man
is everywhere in New York, in America;
he is in our own souls. And when he musters
courage to become Bill Wrenn, when
he sets out on dangerous quests and loves
strange beauty, he becomes a conqueror
who rallies with him the great of history,
and stands on the high places of our own
spirits.
</p>

<p>
Pitifully inadequate Bill Wrenn is, of
course. The lonely tragedy of that conventionally
&ldquo;happy ending&rdquo; has escaped
the critics. The drab, the commonplace,
creep over Bill again without his knowing
it. That&rsquo;s the frightful part of it.
It&rsquo;s very like what appears to happen to
everybody. Our Mr. Wrenn he is at the
end, sunk in comfort and forgetting his
flags in sunsets.
</p>

<p>
It is a poignant, bitterly human novel.
After reading it in sympathy one cannot
lean back in satisfaction and write commonplaces.
It leads to understandings
and resolutions. When we learn to demand
such things of American writers,
their primary purpose will then cease
to be either to entertain or to &ldquo;teach a
lesson.&rdquo;

Lantern Gleams
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Little Essays in Literature and Life</em>, by Richard Burton.
[The Century Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">R</span><span class="postfirstchar">eaders</span> of <em>The Bellman</em> will welcome
in this permanent form many little lantern
gleams of thought that have been
shed athwart their path by this unacademically-minded
incumbent of a Minnesota
chair.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Burton flashes his lamp fitfully
over a large area, and shows us loitering
spots as well as boggy ground it were
well to avoid. Opening his book at random,
we find here a hint on reading and
here a warning gleam over some political
or social morass.
</p>

<p>
When the morass is a deep one, however,
we must not expect to sound its
depths with a lantern gleam, and so
sometimes Mr. Burton disappoints us.
Thus in discussing the individual and society
he merely tells us what we all know:
that we pay for the advantage of sociality,
of mutual comfort, and support
by the loss of individuality, by the
growth of a fear to do the thing that
commends itself to our best judgment.
But what must we do? Must we fill in
this particular morass by throwing in all
the individuals? Or will the individuals
be able to jump it? Mr. Burton is discreet
on such points.
</p>

<p>
More satisfactory than that essay and
others like it are those on literature.
Under &ldquo;Books and Men&rdquo; the author deplores
the tendency which characterized
Chaucer (&ldquo;Farewell my books and my
devotion&rdquo;) of drawing an antithesis between
men and books, between literature
and life. Literature has its origin in
life and its apparent separation from it
is an accidental result of the printed
book method of spreading what used to
be spread by the human voice alone or in
chorus.

About Nietzsche
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Nietzsche and Other Exponents of Individualism</em>, by Paul Carus.
[The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">xpositions</span> of Nietzsche are usually
written by uncritical disciples with little
knowledge of formal philosophy. In so
far as Nietzsche was a poet, some of
these productions may be of value in
spots, but in so far as Nietzsche was an
intellectual critic of life they are worthless.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Carus writes from the standpoint
of a philosopher in the most formal
sense of that word. To him Nietzsche
the thundering voice of protest named
<em>Zarathustra</em> is of less importance than
Nietzsche the extreme nominalist. The
chief value of his work therefore is purely
informative. He will certainly not
send the philosophic debutante further
into the matter.
</p>

<p>
Even from the purely informative
side, however, Dr. Carus&rsquo;s work is delimited
by his own attitude, which is that
of the old time believer in the validity of
universals. Recurrence, uniformity, eternal
norms of things behind the changing
phenomena are the foundations of Dr.
Carus&rsquo;s stated or implied world view.
</p>

<p>
He therefore treats Nietzsche as simply
a forerunner of such, to him, mischievous
people as William James and
Henri Bergson. He takes great pains,
indeed, to show that there are many
Nietzsches, and among them he classes
George Moore, on the strength of extracts
from his <em>Confessions of a Young
Man</em>. Of more value than that is his
consideration of the philosophy of Stirner&mdash;mainly
because Stirner is not so
well known as Nietzsche, nor so well as
he deserves to be on his merits.
</p>

<p>
One undoubted merit the book has, and
that is the industrious collection of personal
recollections of Nietzsche and of
Nietzsche portraits which Dr. Carus has
brought together in its pages. These
will give the book a positive value to the
Nietzsche enthusiast, while the sight of
Dr. Carus&rsquo;s cool, scholastic temperament
trying to drench the burning bush of
Nietzsche will at least interest him.

Feminism and New Music
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Anthony the Absolute</em>, by Samuel Merwin.
[The Century Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is interesting to watch the struggles
of an essentially chivalrous masculine
soul caught in the whirlpool of modern
feminism. Samuel Merwin, ever since
the old days of <em>A Short Line War</em> and
<em>Calumet K.</em>, written in collaboration with
Henry Kitchell Webster, has held
towards women the attitude of the
knight errant. Recently, as shown in
<em>The Citadel</em>, <em>The Charmed Life of Miss
Austin</em>, and even more strongly in this
latest book, <em>Anthony the Absolute</em>, he
has become a determined feminist. But
the attitude has not changed. Formerly
his hero laid at the feet of the lady of his
choice as much wealth, fame, and position
as he could acquire; this latest hero
gives her in the same spirit a career and
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
the chance to develop her own personality.
Mr. Merwin says: &ldquo;The man
who deliberately stops a woman&rsquo;s growth&mdash;no
matter what his traditions; no
matter what his fears for her&mdash;is doing
a monstrous thing, a thing for which
he must some day answer to the God of
all life.&rdquo; He is still the knight errant.
It is still man who permits woman to develop.
</p>

<p>
None the less it is a very readable tale.
The male characters are all clearly and
convincingly drawn, not without humor.
The lady is a little nebulous, but very
charming. Illustrating the absoluteness
of Anthony and serving as an introduction
to the charming Heloise is an interesting
musical theme. The scene is laid
in China, where Anthony is studying
primitive music, and Heloise is able to
sing for him a perfect close-interval
scale, in eighth tones instead of the
&ldquo;barbarous&rdquo; half and whole tones of
the piano scale.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Mr. Merwin has permitted
himself to be led by the exigencies
of a popular magazine, in which the
story appeared in serial form, into giving
the tale a certain meretricious air of
sex allurement which it fundamentally
does not possess. On the whole, except
in a certain technical facility in handling
the situations and sustaining the tension
of the plot, <em>Anthony the Absolute</em> is a
decided falling below the really splendid
standard of excellence which Mr. Merwin
set for himself in <em>The Citadel</em>.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">s</span> it true that a Chicago woman&rsquo;s
club recently declared any book to be
immoral which contains a character whom
you wouldn&rsquo;t invite into your home to
meet your daughter? If so, the world is
to be congratulated, because all novels
except the <span class="smallcaps">Rollo Books</span> are labeled immoral,
and we needn&rsquo;t worry any more
about the word. Provided, of course,
that the daughters of this particular
woman&rsquo;s club are sheltered as carefully
as they should be, having been brought
up by such mothers.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m afraid only authors and publishers
know just how threatening this fear of
&ldquo;immoral&rdquo; books is getting to be. The
most significant American novelist has
just written a masterful book which has
been declined by two at least of the oldest
and best publishing houses because it
is &ldquo;too frank.&rdquo; The men in charge want
to publish it; they think the world ought
to have a chance at it. But they are
afraid. And the author, unlike most authors
under similar circumstances, won&rsquo;t
modify the book. He says he&rsquo;ll wait
twenty-five years, if necessary, but he
won&rsquo;t change a word. And yet, if
the book were published, some people
would accuse him of &ldquo;pandering to
commercialism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t blame the publisher. Mitchell
Kennerley came near being fined hundreds
of dollars and sent to jail recently
for issuing <em>Hagar Revelly</em>&mdash;a serious
though by no means a great novel.
Anthony Comstock, who earns his living
by attempting to suppress anything
which he happens to consider immoral, is
likely at any time to pick out a good
piece of work for his thunderbolts&mdash;and
he is a government official in the post office
department. You can&rsquo;t tell what he
is going to do next. Everybody remembers
his ill-advised censorship of Paul
Chabas&rsquo;s delicate and inoffensive little
<em>September Morn</em>; yet in every cheap picture-store
window in New York there is
now displayed without protest a photograph
of a nude woman which makes no
pretense to art or beauty.
</p>

<p>
Not many people know that six men
decide what Boston may or may not read.
<em>The Watch and Ward Society</em>, a group
of puritans backed up by the blue laws of
the state, have long been active in this
pharisaical undertaking and from time to
time have arrested booksellers. The
booksellers in self-defense have recently
formed a committee of three to act with
three members of this society. When a
new book comes along which anybody
&ldquo;suspects,&rdquo; it is put before the joint
committee, and if that decides against it,
Boston cannot buy it except by mail.
<em>The Devil&rsquo;s Garden</em> only barely escaped,
because somebody had read to the end of
the book and labeled it &ldquo;religious.&rdquo; In
other words, it teaches a lesson. But the
same argument did not save Witter Bynner&rsquo;s
<em>Tiger</em>.
</p>

<p>
Magazine editors will tell you similar
facts by the hour. The <em>Metropolitan</em>
was recently held up by the post office because
it contained photographs of nude
statuary&mdash;from the winter exhibition of
the National Academy!
</p>

<p>
We shall not rid ourselves of this
vicious situation by simply getting enraged
at the censors. The truth is, they
are too well entrenched in public opinion.
The people who enforce the law are
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
ignorant postal clerks, clergymen of archaic
convictions, and lower court judges
of the tobacco-chewing, corner-saloon
type to whom any thought of sex is
necessarily nasty. But behind them is
the man who is always saying that such
and such a book or play &ldquo;oughtn&rsquo;t to be
allowed.&rdquo; He is always wanting to protect
&ldquo;the young,&rdquo; or somebody else, although
he rarely reads books himself,
and probably would resent interference
with his own often vicious pleasures. His
mind is essentially rotten. He is incapable
of understanding the pure beauty of
the human body, because he has seen so
many &ldquo;musical comedies.&rdquo; He would be
shocked by the statement that passion is
a beautiful element of nature toward
which we should be reverent. He has a
sense of propriety, not so much about
what should be done as about what should
be said. And then there is the vast Florence
Barclay contingent, largely women,
who, because they don&rsquo;t know what the
world is like, don&rsquo;t want to know, and
don&rsquo;t think anybody should be allowed to
know.
</p>

<p>
The trouble with censorship is that we
always want it to apply to other people,
never to ourselves. It is our national
weakness that we try to prescribe conduct
by law, instead of seeing that the
individual is strong and truth-seeing, and
leaving conduct to take care of itself, allowing
ideas to fight their own battles. If
we must have a censorship, let it be in the
hands of the strong and intelligent. Let
us forbid all books which are not true.
Mental and moral fibre is really vitiated
by the Florence Barclay sort of thing.
People brought up on that are enemies
of light and progress. Their world is
an exercise-place for impossible ethics.
Their emotion is washed-out sentiment.
Courage and vigor are unknown to them.
And the worst of it is that their soft and
clinging hands are wrapped about the
rest of us, as they try to drag us down
from the rain-washed skies of the morning
to their stuffy hair-cloth religion and
pink-candy pleasures.
</p>

<p>
The fight between the writers and the
censors is sure to grow bitter in the next
few years; both sides are getting more
determined every day. But such crises
are welcomed by the adventurous. We
shall end not only by riding over our
small opponents, but by carrying with
us an army awakened to the true issues
of art and life.

William Butler Yeats to American Poets
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> current number of <em>Poetry</em> prints
a speech that William Butler Yeats made
during his recent visit to Chicago, in
which he took occasion to warn his confreres
in America against a number of
besetting sins. He said, in part:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Twenty-five years ago a celebrated writer
from South Africa said she lived in the East
End of London because only there could she see
the faces of people without a mask. To this
Oscar Wilde replied that he lived in the West
End because nothing interested him but the
mask. After a week of lecturing I am too tired
to assume a mask, so I will address my remarks
especially to a fellow craftsman. For since
coming to Chicago I have read several times a
poem by Mr. Lindsay, one which will be in the
anthologies, <em>General Booth Enters Into Heaven</em>.
This poem is stripped bare of ornament; it has
an earnest simplicity, a strange beauty, and you
know Bacon said, &ldquo;There is no excellent beauty
without strangeness.&rdquo; ...
</p>

<p>
I have lived a good many years and have read
many writers. When I was younger than Mr.
Lindsay, and was beginning to write in Ireland,
there was all around me the rhetorical poetry
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
of the Irish politicians. We young writers rebelled
against that rhetoric; there was too much
of it and to a great extent it was meaningless.
When I went to London I found a group of
young lyric writers who were also against rhetoric.
We formed the Rhymers&rsquo; Club; we used
to meet and read our poems to one another, and
we tried to rid them of rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
But now, when I open the ordinary American
magazine, I find that all we rebelled against in
those early days&mdash;the sentimentality, the rhetoric,
the &ldquo;moral uplift&rdquo;&mdash;still exists here.
Not because you are too far from England, but
because you are too far from Paris.
</p>

<p>
It is from Paris that nearly all the great influences
in art and literature have come, from
the time of Chaucer until now. Today the
metrical experiments of French poets are overwhelming
in their variety and delicacy. The
best English writing is dominated by French
criticism; in France is the great critical mind.
</p>

<p>
The Victorians forgot this; also, they forgot
the austerity of art and began to preach. When
I saw Paul Verlaine in Paris, he told me that
he could not translate Tennyson because he was
&ldquo;too <em>Anglais</em>, too noble&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;when he should
be broken-hearted he has too many reminiscences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We in England, our little group of rhymers,
were weary of all this. We wanted to get rid
not only of rhetoric but of poetic diction. We
tried to strip away everything that was artificial,
to get a style like speech, as simple as the
simplest prose, like a cry of the heart....
</p>

<p>
Real enjoyment of a beautiful thing is not
achieved when a poet tries to teach. It is not
the business of a poet to instruct his age. He
should be too humble to instruct his age. His
business is merely to express himself, whatever
that self may be. I would have all American
poets keep in mind the example of François
Villon.
</p>

<p>
So you who are readers should encourage
American poets to strive to become very simple,
very humble. Your poet must put the fervor
of his life into his work, giving you his emotions
before the world, the evil with the good,
not thinking whether he is a good man or a bad
man, or whether he is teaching you. A poet
does not know whether he is a good man. If he
is a good man, he probably thinks he is a bad
man.
</p>

<p>
Poetry that is naturally simple, that might
exist as the simplest prose, should have instantaneousness
of effect, provided it finds the right
audience. You may have to wait years for that
audience, but when it is found that instantaneousness
of effect is produced....
</p>

<p>
We rebelled against rhetoric, and now there is
a group of younger poets who dare to call us
rhetorical. When I returned to London from
Ireland, I had a young man go over all my work
with me to eliminate the abstract. This was an
American poet, Ezra Pound. Much of his work
is experimental; his work will come slowly, he
will make many an experiment before he comes
into his own. I should like to read to you two
poems of permanent value, <em>The Ballad of the
Goodly Fere</em> and <em>The Return</em>. This last is, I
think, the most beautiful poem that has been
written in the free form, one of the few in
which I find real organic rhythm. A great
many poets use <em>vers libre</em> because they think it
is easier to write than rhymed verse, but it is
much more difficult.
</p>

<p>
The whole movement of poetry is toward pictures,
sensuous images, away from rhetoric, from
the abstract, toward humility. But I fear I am
now becoming rhetorical. I have been driven
into Irish public life&mdash;how can I avoid rhetoric?

Letters to The Little Review
</h2>

</div>

<div class="letters">
<p>
What an insouciant little pagan paper
you flourish before our bewildered eyes!
Please accept the congratulations of a
stranger.
</p>

<p>
But you must not scoff at age, little
bright eyes, for some day you, too,
will know age; and you should not jeer
at robustness of form, slim one, for the
time may come when you, too, will find
the burdens of flesh upon you. Above
all, do not proclaim too loudly the substitution
of Nietzsche for Jesus of the
Little Town in the niche of your invisible
temple, for when you are broken and
forgotten there is no comfort in the
Overman.
</p>

<p>
One thing more: Restraint is sometimes
better than expression. One who
has learned this lesson cannot refrain
from saying this apropos of the first
paragraphs in the criticism of <em>The Dark
Flower</em>. Do not give folk a chance to
misunderstand you. Being a woman, you
have to pay too high a price for moments
of high intellectual orgy.
</p>

<p>
Forgive all this and go on valiantly.

<p>
I am greatly indebted for a copy of
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. I take this
opportunity of stating that the publication
is one of the cleverest and best
things I have seen. It deserves success,
for it contains stuff which will compare
very favorably with the best that is
being written.
</p>

<p class="sign">

</p>

<p>
Will you allow me to congratulate you
on your magnificent effort in bringing
out <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>?
</p>

<p>
I have found it very refreshing after
having suffered for so long by reading
the so-called book review magazines that
have no right to more than passing notice.
</p>

<p>
You have accomplished wonders, and
if your efforts of the future come up
to those put into the first number of <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span>, your success is assured.
</p>

<p>
The best wish I can offer is that its
path may be covered with roses and bordered
with the trees of prosperity.
</p>

<p>
Again congratulating you, I am, with
every good wish, very truly yours,

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> came this morning!
And I have read it all! And I
love it! Much more than I expected, to
be perfectly honest! I feared something
too radical&mdash;too modern&mdash;if that is
possible. If it had been like <em>The Masses</em>&mdash;well,
I can never express my contempt
for that sheet. But you&rsquo;re perfectly
sane, intelligent, readable, and enthusiastic&mdash;gloriously
so!
</p>

<p>
Your description of Kreisler is worth
much to me. It is precisely what I have
always felt about him. Paderewski, too.
But I think the Mason and Hamlin reference
a little too commercial. I realize
you want <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> to be
straightforward, honest, intimate, etc.,
but I fear that kind of thing will be
taken as advertisement and not as a
personal belief and enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
If I should never know anything more
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
of Mr. George Soule than his sonnet and
New York letter I should have to like
him. The man who could feel and write
that last paragraph is a splendid type.
</p>

<p>
But the whole thing is beautiful, and
worth while, whether you agree with it
all or not. A thousand congratulations!

<p class="note">
[Of course our remarks about the Mason and
Hamlin violated all journalistic traditions. But
traditions are so likely to need violation, and
diplomacy and caution are such uninteresting
qualities! What we feel and tried to say about
that piano is that it&rsquo;s as definitely a work of art
as good poetry or good music. Why not say so,
quite naturally? We know something of the
man who is responsible for its quality of tone;
he&rsquo;s as authentic an artist as those musicians
who create on his foundations. Is there any
reason why such an achievement is not to be
mentioned in a journal that means to devote
itself to beauty? Is anything vital ever gained
by a cautious regard for &ldquo;<em>on dit</em>&rdquo;? Above
all, if one can discover no importance in
journalistic tradition of that type, why defer
to it?&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">The Editor.</span>]
</p>

<p>
I haven&rsquo;t got over your beautiful
magazine yet. Don&rsquo;t let anybody keep
you from making it a truthful expression
of yourself&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
First of all, it&rsquo;s beautifully made. You
couldn&rsquo;t have done better typographically.
It&rsquo;s the most <em>inviting</em> magazine
published. I like the color and the paper
label.
</p>

<p>
Second, its spirit blows keen and with
a pure fragrance. If you can continue
to show such freshness you will have
gone far toward achieving the goal Mr.
Galsworthy urges&mdash;that &ldquo;sleeping out
under the stars&rdquo; which cleans our hearts
of all things artificial.

for it meant folks were interested in the

interested in literature; everything in it
is fine, even unto the composition of the
&ldquo;ad&rdquo; pages. With its fresh, cheerful

<p>
There are so many things that I admire
in the first issue of <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span> that I find it difficult to decide
just where to begin. It was like taking
up a copy of the Preludes of <a id="corr-10"></a>Debussy
for the first time; after playing them
over and over again I found it difficult
to know whether it was what he said or
the way he said it which held the greater
charm for me. I congratulate you most
sincerely on the distinct personal quality
which is so evident in your magazine
and you may count upon me to rejoice
with you if it meets with anything like
the great success which it so distinctly
merits.

<p>
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
Your new publication has just fallen
into my hands. The vital thing!
</p>

<p>
I cannot begin to tell you what its
pulsating, teeming import means to me.
I know nothing today in magazine form
that will mean so much to busy, thinking
people.
</p>

<p class="sign">

</p>

<p>
Please let me offer my sincerest congratulations
and my warmest wishes for
the continued success of <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span>. There are numerous points in
the first issue that I should like to discuss
with you; I must warn you that you are
tempting your readers and must not
be surprised if you are overwhelmed
with letters, questioning, approving, and
criticising.
</p>

<p>
The foreword strikes such a splendid
note! I hope no criticism will influence
you to change it.
</p>

<p>
You agree, evidently, with the point
that <em>The Dark Flower</em> suggests a Greek
classic; so do I. But, conceding that,
how could you have been surprised that
countless people care nothing for it?
Don&rsquo;t you know that the majority of
people in the world do not really &ldquo;possess&rdquo;
the Greek classics? Without the
background of the world&rsquo;s thought, ages
ago, and its progress&mdash;unless we agree
with Alfred Russell Wallace that we have
made no progress&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see that
<em>The Dark Flower</em> could genuinely startle
many people? So I beg for less sharpness
toward those who do not feel the
wonder of it. The tragedy is in their
lives.
</p>

<p>
For just the same reason <em>Jean Christophe</em>
belongs to a few, comparatively.
If you had never before felt the power of
a great epic, could you really grasp this
one? Modern as we claim to be&mdash;and
independent&mdash;must there not be some
foundation? Oh dear!&mdash;I do want to
tell you why I think <em>Vanity Fair</em> is
greater than <em>Succession</em> and why Ysaye&rsquo;s
music is inspired&mdash;when I listen, at
least. But one can&rsquo;t go on forever.
</p>

<p>
Since the &ldquo;Critics&rsquo; Critic&rdquo; expressed a
doubt about that quotation from Euripides
and since you insisted that it sounded
like a Gilbert Murray translation, you
may be glad to know that it is both.
But you quoted it wrong. It is from
<em>Aeolus</em>, a lost play, and this is the correct
version:
</p>

  <div class="excerpt">
    <div class="poem-container">
      <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
        <p class="verse">This Cyprian,</p>
        <p class="verse">She is a thousand, thousand changing things;</p>
        <p class="verse">She brings more pain than any god; she brings</p>
        <p class="verse">More joy. I cannot judge her. May it be</p>
        <p class="verse">An hour of mercy when she looks on me.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p class="noindent">
I do agree that &ldquo;a million, million
changing things&rdquo; is somehow more perfect;
I even agree now, though not at
first, with the order of attributes: &ldquo;She
brings more joy than any god, she brings
more pain.&rdquo; On a re-reading of <em>Aeolus</em>
I am taken with the way you misquoted
it. Joy was surely first in the Greek&rsquo;s
life. And of course the human beauty
of the thing made me think immediately
of the way Mrs. Browning &ldquo;struck off&rdquo;
Euripides:
</p>

  <div class="excerpt">
    <div class="poem-container">
      <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
        <p class="verse">Our Euripides, the human,</p>
          <p class="verse1">With his droppings of warm tears</p>
        <p class="verse">And his touches of things common</p>
          <p class="verse1">Till they rose to touch the spheres!</p>

<p>
... I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve read anything
so inspiring as that letter from
Galsworthy. Can&rsquo;t all of you who are
helping to make the magazine arrange
to march up to it mentally and present
your &ldquo;copy&rdquo; for approval before you
decide to print it?
</p>

<p>
I like the article on Paderewski and
the one about <em>The Dark Flower</em>. But do
be careful of &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; and &ldquo;passion.&rdquo;
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
It&rsquo;s easy to make them commonplace.
Also spare your adjectives a bit; you
don&rsquo;t need an adjective for everything.
I realize that your abbreviations are
made in the interest of readableness, but
however informal you want to make it
you only succeed in sounding hideously
colloquial. It doesn&rsquo;t read well, and it
makes me feel that you&rsquo;re trying to
achieve through the style what ought to
be achieved quite simply through the material
itself. Not that I approve of
anything stilted, but you can easily overdo
the other side of it. And wouldn&rsquo;t it
be better to leave some of the things unsigned?
People who don&rsquo;t know that
the various Anderson contributors are
unrelated will think it&rsquo;s rather a family
monopoly.
</p>

<p>
The Ficke poems are exquisite; and
how I love Nicholas Vachel Lindsay&rsquo;s!
Also I like the New York letter very
much, but George Soule&rsquo;s <em>Major Symphony</em>
could just as well be unwritten.
Poetry has to be so much better than
that to be real poetry. Another thing:
I think your quotations from <em>Succession</em>
weren&rsquo;t as efficient as you hoped. It&rsquo;s a
book that can&rsquo;t well be quoted except to
one who knows it.
</p>

<p>
You wanted frankness, so here it is.
Otherwise, I have nothing but praise for
the whole glorious undertaking!

<p>
If you will allow me to be perfectly

to tell you that <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
seems rather too esthetic in tone and
spirit to avoid being &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo;&mdash;a
wish you expressed in your editorial.
There is not enough variety in it, for
one thing. For another, some of its
critical judgments are too personal&mdash;are
too largely temperamental judgments&mdash;to
be of any permanent value. You
seem to have set out to exploit personalities;
and there&rsquo;s a juvenility in many of
the articles that I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll all

promptly, but I was unable to read it

my first mistake, as I had been denying
myself a very pleasant two hours. My
second mistake was in having read it at
all, as it has now become one of those
eight or ten journals which are always
welcome and more or less necessary. Ten
journals each month (and some weeklies),
quietly yet insistently urging me
to take them up, are like those good

I loved the Paderewski, too. Was
there anything more wonderful than the
glory of the Funeral March as he played
it the afternoon of his first recital here

<p>
I want to tell you how very good the
first issue of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is. I
don&rsquo;t know what the succeeding numbers
will be like, but you have set a <a id="corr-11"></a>pace in
this one that will demand some vigorous
effort to keep up. After that &ldquo;gripping&rdquo;
announcement no one will doubt
the real purpose of the <span class="smallcaps">Review</span> and the
fine optimism that is behind it. I don&rsquo;t
have to believe everything you are going
to print, but if those who write it do, by
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
all means keep them together. And <em>don&rsquo;t</em>
let George Soule get away.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s too early to make suggestions, but
I should say that Number One is well balanced
and very readable, and I like the
trick of throwing the light on from different
angles&mdash;like the Galsworthy and
Nietzsche discussions. The tone is high,
and I am quite sure I never read more
intelligent reviews anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Good luck to <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>!

Will you let me thank you for giving
me a very pleasant experience in reading
the first copy of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>?
There are many things in the first number
which arouse one&rsquo;s interest, though
I am not sure that I would at all agree
in all the critical judgments which are
there pronounced. Anyway, you will
let me wish you all success, and wave
you my hand with the hope that <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> shall be the biggest review
in the country.

<p>
Congratulations must be pouring in
on you from all sides, but I want, just
the same, to add my voice to the chorus
of &ldquo;Bravos&rdquo; that surrounds you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is a triumph. It
even outdoes my picture of it; and that
is saying much, for I have known it was
to be something exceptionally nice.
</p>

<p>
It is a delight to look at, showing
somebody&rsquo;s good personal taste; and the
contents&mdash;well, I like them <em>lots</em> more
than I could say adequately or put in
this space.
</p>

<p>
Blessings on you and the heartiest
congratulations to all concerned in the
making of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.

I am pleased with its general appearance,
and the contents are inspiring&mdash;full
of the spirit of youth. I wish <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> every success.

<p>
The initial number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span> has impressed me so favorably
that I want some of my friends also to
share in its appreciation.
</p>

<p>
You surely have made a fine beginning
and, in my judgment, cannot do
better than to adopt as the creed of
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> the sound and encouraging
advice given in Mr. Galsworthy&rsquo;s
inspiring letter.

<p>
From the first page to the last book
announcement I have read <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span> with pride and delight.
</p>

<p>
Its sincerity attracts me even more
than its obvious literary merit, and its
comprehensiveness and quality will appeal
to all who read at all&mdash;especially
to those who go below the surface.

<p>
Thank you so much for <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span>! I liked it from the moment I
saw it, both outside and in. I like particularly
the personal note you put into
your writing. It&rsquo;s as though you were
really talking to me and telling me how
you feel about <em>The Dark Flower</em> and
Paderewski and dear Little Antoine with
his bad room that was &ldquo;pretty but stupid
for the sound.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With best wishes to you in your beautiful,
big undertaking.

<p>
This splendid story of love
which has drawn more attention
than anything else Mr. Galsworthy
ever wrote, is now in its
fourth large edition.
</p>

<p>
The editor of the new <em>Little
Review</em> says of it: &ldquo;Everything
John Galsworthy has done has
had its special function in making
&lsquo;The Dark Flower&rsquo; possible.
The sociology of &lsquo;Fraternity,&rsquo;
the passionate pleading of &lsquo;Justice&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Strife,&rsquo; the incomparable
emotional experiments of &lsquo;A
Commentary,&rsquo; the intellectuality
of &lsquo;The Patrician&rsquo;&mdash;all these
have contributed to the noble
simplicity of &lsquo;The Dark Flower.&rsquo;&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Galsworthy deals with
the problem of woman&rsquo;s economic
independence, her opportunity
and preparation for self-support
outside the refuge of
marriage....
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The Fugitive&rsquo; is an admirable
piece of dramatic writing.
The undeviating exposition of the
situation in the first act is certainly
the best thing Mr. Galsworthy
has yet done in the dramatic
field.&rdquo;

<p>
The years this volume embraces were three of the most critical
in the life of the French Republic. Their principal events
and conspicuous characters are vividly described by an expert
writer who was within the inmost circles of society and diplomacy&mdash;she
was the daughter of President King of Columbia, and
had just married M. William Waddington, one of the leading
French diplomats and statesmen of the time.

Harvard, as it was in the days when, first William, and then

the early lives of William and Henry, which was begun in &ldquo;A
Small Boy and Others,&rdquo; published a year ago. Among the distinguished
men pictured in its pages are John LaFarge, Hunt,
Professor Norton, Professor Childs, and Ralph Waldo Emerson,
who was a close friend of Henry James, Senior.

North Africa and the Desert

<span class="smallcaps">By George E. Woodberry.</span> <em>$2.00 net; postage extra.</em>
</p>

<p>
This is one of that very small group of books in which a man
of genuine poetic vision has permanently registered the color and
spirit of a region and a race. It is as full of atmosphere and
sympathetic interpretation as any that have been written. Chapters
like that on &ldquo;Figuig,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tougourt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tripoli,&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the
Mat&rdquo;&mdash;a thoughtful study of Islam&mdash;have a rare value and beauty.

The Ascent of Denali (Mt. McKinley)

<p class="adp">
<em>With illustrations and maps</em> <em>$1.75 net; postage extra.</em>
</p>

<p>
The fact that this narrative describes the only successful
attempt to climb this continent&rsquo;s highest mountain peak, and
that the writer led the successful expedition, is enough to give
it an intense interest. But when the writer happens to be as
sensitive as an artist to all the sights and sounds and incidents
of his great adventure, and to be so skilful a writer to convey
everything to the reader, the value and interest of the book are
irresistible.

<p>
If you would see the vast snow-fields, frozen rivers, and
rugged, barren mountains of the Yukon country but cannot visit
them you will do the next best thing by reading this often
beautiful account of a missionary&rsquo;s ten thousand miles of travel
in following his hard and dangerous
work. It is the story of a brave life
amid harsh, grand, and sometimes
awful surroundings.

Success</em>
</p>

<p class="ada">
<span class="underline"><em>By Leona Dalrymple</em></span>
</p>

<p>
Viewed even in the critical light of the high
standard set for the winner of a ten-thousand-dollar
prize, &ldquo;Diane of the Green Van&rdquo; fully
measures up to the expectations of the novel-reading
public.
</p>

<p>
This is why it heads the list of best sellers in
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia. The advertising
value of a big prize offer may account in
some degree for the heavy advance sale&mdash;although
the wholesale buyers ordered <em>after reading</em>.
Nothing but sheer merit can account for
the extremely large retail sale. Friend-to-friend
commendation is steadily increasing over-the-counter
demand.
</p>

<p>
The judges&mdash;the readers&mdash;all gave &ldquo;Diane&rdquo;
first place among five hundred manuscripts,
many of them by first-class authors. The trade
has applauded the choice. Reviewers have called
&ldquo;Diane of the Green Van&rdquo; well worth the big
prize.
</p>

<p>
We should like to be able to publish the list
of twenty or more successful writers who entered
stories. On reputation alone, their work
would have gone far; but we feel that the <em>story</em>
of &ldquo;Diane&rdquo; will go farther.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here are expectation and enthusiasm
justified alike. It is a clear, clean, clever
romance.... It combines the love
and intrigue of the &lsquo;Zenda&rsquo; tale with the
freedom of a Locke or Farnol story of
broad highways.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>New York World.</em>
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
&ldquo;Just what countless pleased readers
will devour with avidity.... Gracefully
written, vivid in style and suggestion....
Bright and breezy and exciting.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Chicago
Record Herald.</em>
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
&ldquo;The tale has unusual dramatic grip,
much brilliancy of dialogue.... It
is the sort of narrative that no one willingly
lays down until the last page has
been turned.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Philadelphia
North American.</em>
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
&ldquo;The novel throbs with the youthful
joy of living and the enchantments of
summer hover over its pages. Everywhere
is there originality in the invention
of the incidents and subtlety in the delineation
of characters.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Chicago
Tribune.</em>
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
&ldquo;A heroine whose fascination richly
merits study. A hero who will capture
the heart of the reader from the moment
of his first appearance.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Boston Globe.</em>
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
&ldquo;So good a thing, a thing so romantic
and thrilling, we have not seen in&mdash;lo,
these many moons of story telling.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Louisville
Post.</em>
</p>

<hr />

<p>
&ldquo;Diane&rdquo; is a tale with the freshness and spontaneity of youth, with the rich personality
of the author shining through its diverting pages. In its imagination and clever dialogue
and plot it strikes the keynote of popular appeal. At the same time, &ldquo;Diane&rdquo; has
all the essentials of lasting popularity. The publishers feel justified in predicting a
long journey for the Green Van and its charming young mistress. (<em>$1.35 net</em>)

The Coming Hawaii
</p>

<p class="ada">
By JOSEPH KING GOODRICH
</p>

<p>
Beginning with Captain Cook and even earlier navigators, the history of this
&ldquo;Paradise of the Pacific&rdquo; is briefly told. Descriptions of the character and life of the
natives and newcomers follow, and full space is given to the attractions of the islands
for tourists and settlers. The products, business and possibilities receive abundant
mention, and little worthy of interest is left untouched. The volume is a timely addition
to the &ldquo;The World Today Series.&rdquo; The statistics are up to date. Illustrated.

Cubists and Post-Impressionism
</p>

<p class="ada">
By ARTHUR JEROME EDDY
</p>

<p class="ads">
Author of &ldquo;Delight; the Soul of Art,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The New Competition&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This remarkable work is far more than an exposition of certain styles of painting,
but while broadly historical and descriptive of many men and schools, presents a plea
for the public to react to new impressions, and a defence of freedom for the artist to
express himself untrammeled by the past. Illustrated by twenty-four color plates
and over forty half-tones of the pictures under discussion. Boxed. <b>Net $3.00</b>

The Art of Story-Telling
</p>

<p class="ada">
By JULIA DARROW COWLES
</p>

<p>
Out of her broad experience and love for the work, Miss Cowles tells how the art
can be made to minister the highest service. She describes story-telling in the home
and in the school, and treats at length of different kinds of stories&mdash;fables, myths,
hero tales, Bible, and many other kinds which may delight and help the children.
Parents, teachers, and others who would use this art most profitably and happily, will
find here just what they want. <b>Net $1.00</b>

Gerhart Hauptmann: His Life and Work
</p>

<p class="ada">
By KARL HOLL
</p>

<p>
Gerhart Hauptmann is as yet only known to English readers by some of his works,
although since he obtained the Nobel Prize for literature, English and American interest
in his work has increased. Dr. Holl describes his personal life and character,
and his works from the first epic, afterward suppressed, to the present time. This
is a most important piece of critical literature, both on account of its intrinsic merits
and because it is alone in its field. <b>Net $1.00</b>
